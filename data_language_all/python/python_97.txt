    The request context is automatically popped at the end of the request
    for you.  In debug mode the request context is kept around if
    exceptions happen so that interactive debuggers have a chance to
    introspect the data.  With 0.4 this can also be forced for requests
    that did not fail and outside of ``DEBUG`` mode.  By setting
    ``'flask._preserve_context'`` to ``True`` on the WSGI environment the
    context will not pop itself at the end of the request.  This is used by
    the :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_client` for example to implement the
    deferred cleanup functionality.

    You might find this helpful for unittests where you need the
    information from the context local around for a little longer.  Make
    sure to properly :meth:`~werkzeug.LocalStack.pop` the stack yourself in

            return render_template('index.html', foo=42)

    You can now do something like this::

        def index():
            response = make_response(render_template('index.html', foo=42))
            response.headers['X-Parachutes'] = 'parachutes are cool'
            return response

    This function accepts the very same arguments you can return from a
    view function.  This for example creates a response with a 404 error
    code::

        response = make_response(render_template('not_found.html'), 404)

    The other use case of this function is to force the return value of a
    view function into a response which is helpful with view
    decorators::

        response = make_response(view_function())
        response.headers['X-Parachutes'] = 'parachutes are cool'

    Internally this function does the following things:

    -   if no arguments are passed, it creates a new response argument
    -   if one argument is passed, :meth:`flask.Flask.make_response`
        is invoked with it.
    -   if more than one argument is passed, the arguments are passed
        to the :meth:`flask.Flask.make_response` function as tuple.

    To integrate applications, :class:`Flask` has a hook to intercept URL build
    errors through :attr:`Flask.url_build_error_handlers`.  The `url_for`
    function results in a :exc:`~werkzeug.routing.BuildError` when the current
    app does not have a URL for the given endpoint and values.  When it does, the
    :data:`~flask.current_app` calls its :attr:`~Flask.url_build_error_handlers` if
    it is not ``None``, which can return a string to use as the result of
    `url_for` (instead of `url_for`'s default to raise the
    :exc:`~werkzeug.routing.BuildError` exception) or re-raise the exception.
    An example::

        def external_url_handler(error, endpoint, values):
            "Looks up an external URL when `url_for` cannot build a URL."
            # This is an example of hooking the build_error_handler.
            # Here, lookup_url is some utility function you've built
            # which looks up the endpoint in some external URL registry.
            url = lookup_url(endpoint, **values)
            if url is None:
                # External lookup did not have a URL.
                # Re-raise the BuildError, in context of original traceback.
                exc_type, exc_value, tb = sys.exc_info()
                if exc_value is error:
                    raise exc_type, exc_value, tb
                else:

            # url_for will use this result, instead of raising BuildError.
            return url

        app.url_build_error_handlers.append(external_url_handler)

    Here, `error` is the instance of :exc:`~werkzeug.routing.BuildError`, and
    `endpoint` and `values` are the arguments passed into `url_for`.  Note
    that this is for building URLs outside the current application, and not for
