// Arduino bridge code between host computer and LPD8806-based digital
// addressable RGB LEDs (e.g. Adafruit product ID #306).  LED data is
// streamed, not buffered, making this suitable for larger installations
// (e.g. video wall, etc.) than could otherwise be contained within the
// Arduino's limited RAM.  Intended for use with USB-native boards such
// as Teensy or Adafruit 32u4 Breakout; also works on normal serial
// Arduinos (Uno, etc.), but speed will be limited by the serial port.

// LED data and clock lines are connected to the Arduino's SPI output.
// On traditional Arduino boards (e.g. Uno), SPI data out is digital pin
// 11 and clock is digital pin 13.  On both Teensy and the 32u4 Breakout,
// data out is pin B2, clock is B1.  On Arduino Mega, 51=data, 52=clock.
// LEDs should be externally powered -- trying to run any more than just
// a few off the Arduino's 5V line is generally a Bad Idea.  LED ground
// should also be connected to Arduino ground.

// Elsewhere, the WS2801 version of this code was specifically designed
// to avoid buffer underrun conditions...the WS2801 pixels automatically
// latch when the data stream stops for 500 microseconds or more, whether
// intentional or not.  The LPD8806 pixels are fundamentally different --
// the latch condition is indicated within the data stream, not by pausing
// the clock -- and buffer underruns are therefore a non-issue.  In theory
// it would seem this could allow the code to be much simpler and faster
// (there's no need to sync up with a start-of-frame header), but in
// practice the difference was not as pronounced as expected -- such code
// soon ran up against a USB throughput limit anyway.  So, rather than
// break compatibility in the quest for speed that will never materialize,
// this code instead follows the same header format as the WS2801 version.
// This allows the same host-side code (e.g. Adalight, Adavision, etc.)
// to run with either type of LED pixels.  Huzzah!

// frames at the correct time.  You may see an initial glitchy frame or
// two until the two come into alignment.  Immediately following the
// magic word are three bytes: a 16-bit count of the number of LEDs (high
// byte first) followed by a simple checksum value (high byte XOR low byte
// XOR 0x55).  LED data follows, 3 bytes per LED, in order R, G, B, where
// 0 = off and 255 = max brightness.  LPD8806 pixels only have 7-bit
// brightness control, so each value is divided by two; the 8-bit format
// is used to maintain compatibility with the protocol set forth by the
// WS2801 streaming code (those LEDs use 8-bit values).
