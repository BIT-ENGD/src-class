Play Chatroom
This is a simple chatroom using Play and Websockets with the Java API.
This project makes use of dynamic streams from Akka Streams, notably BroadcastHub and MergeHub.  By combining MergeHub and BroadcastHub, you can get publish/subscribe functionality.
The good bit
The flow is defined once in the controller, and used everywhere from the chat action:

Prerequisites
You will need JDK 1.8 and sbt installed.
Running
sbt run
Go to http://localhost:9000 and open it in two different browsers.  Typing into one browser will cause it to show up in another browser.
Tributes
