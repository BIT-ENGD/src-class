Project Analysis
As part of your pre-work submission, please reflect on the app and answer the following questions below:
Question 1: "What are your reactions to the iOS app development platform so far? How would you describe outlets and actions to another developer? Bonus: any idea how they are being implemented under the hood? (It might give you some ideas if you right-click on the Storyboard and click Open As->Source Code")
Answer: Xcode is very powerful in that it gives you preview of the UI work instantly and makes it really simple to link between UI components and controller. Developer can easily have a ui component listening for outlets like value changed, or touch events, then dragging to link one outlet to an action. I guess it works by adding event listener for each component and fires action upon particular event occurs.
Question 2: "Swift uses Automatic Reference Counting (ARC), which is not a garbage collector, to manage memory. Can you explain how you can get a strong reference cycle for closures? (There's a section explaining this concept in the link, how would you summarize as simply as possible?)"
Answer: A reference cycle occurs if class instance has a string reference to closure or closure has a string reference to class instance.
