Autotag Junk Control
The grammars list in the settings defines which languages Autotag should run on. When running autotag-junk-control:open-tag outside of a specified grammar or running it while you have an open tag, it will insert <.
Templates are rendered when you type a character. You don't need to escape @ in your templates.

@[regex] defines regex that closes the tag when you press a key that matches it. It does not accept flags and only accepts POSIX expressions.
@text outputs to the text you type in between the opening and closing characters.
@cursor dictates where the cursor(s) will be placed in the template.
@key is the character pressed to close the tag.

If you want to add a template, keep the originals, and don't wanna dig through the source code to find them (they're at the top), then copy & paste @[>] <@text>@cursor<!--@text-->, @[\s] <@text @cursor><!--@text-->, @[/] <@text @cursor />, @[%?] <@key@text @cursor @key>

TODO:

Add support for enclosing selections with Autotag
Add more robust regex handling to support patterns more than 1 character in length. e.g. being able to match img> and treat it differently than matching >.
