Demo & Examples
To build the examples locally, run:
npm install

Installation
The easiest way to use react-volt-time-picker is to install it from NPM and include it in your own React build process (using Browserify, Webpack, etc).
You can also use the standalone build by including dist/react-volt-time-picker.js in your page. If you use this, make sure you have already included React, and it is available as a global variable.
npm install react-volt-time-picker --save

Development (src, lib and the build process)
NOTE: The source code for the component is in src. A transpiled CommonJS version (generated with Babel) is available in lib for use with node.js, browserify and webpack. A UMD bundle is also built to dist, which can be included without the need for any build system.
To build, watch and serve the examples (which will also watch the component source), run npm start. If you just want to watch changes to src and rebuild lib, run npm run watch (this is useful if you are working with npm link).
