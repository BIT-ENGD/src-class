EGLdb
Simple interception library to trace EGL calls on BlackBerry 10
All debug information is written to slog2, with the prefix "EGL Debug"
Usage
To use, change the library you reference from "-lEGL" to "-lEGLdb" and be sure to add the library as a asset in your descriptor file.
Depending on where you locate the file, you may have to change your library path so the linker is happy.
Additional functionality
If you'd like, you can also reference the "EGL.h" file included. This simply adds a define for you to detect that the debug EGL is in use (EGL_DEBUG) and 3 helper functions:
* eglIsDebugLibraryInitialized - determine if the library is initialized
* eglDebugEnableLogging - enable/disable the logging capability
* eglDebugLog - specify the specific slog2 buffer to log information to. By default, the default slog2 buffer is used.
Hidden gem
If used with a Cascades application, Cascades will use this library too. It doesn't so much, but you will know when it's init. and when it does it's swap buffers and other small calls.
