dichromacyd theme for Emacs 24
Original by Chong Yidong. I've just added some faces and renamed it to set it apart from the original which is included in Emacs itself.
Future
Odds are I won't add anything else, I just felt like using a light theme today and putting it on github for posterity or something.
