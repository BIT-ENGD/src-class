Who Am I?
When I started thinking about building a portfolio site I wanted it to be unique and interactive. In my mind, a site meant to be an introduction should be like a conversation-- fun, interesting, and above all engaging. That's what has gone into the design of this experience, emulating a conversation.

Getting Started
If you want to run the site locally, this project uses webpack-dev-server to test.
Prerequisites
Make sure you have node and yarninstalled.
bash
$ node -v // => 8.x.x+
$ yarn -v // => 1.x.x+
Installing
Once the prerequisites are installed, running install then serve will take care of all the necessary dependencies and spin up the site.
bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn serve
After everything has built successfully, you will be able to access the site at http://localhost:8080/.
Coding style
Consistent coding style is enforced through stylelint and tslint. To run the linting tasks together run yarn lint, or seperately with yarn lint:ts and yarn lint:scss.

NOTE: Each linting task is run with the --fix flag which will attempt to automagically fix certain formatting errors.
Built With

Vue.js - The web framework used
Webpack - Build pipeline
SCSS - CSS preprocessor
TypeScript - JavaScript that scales!
