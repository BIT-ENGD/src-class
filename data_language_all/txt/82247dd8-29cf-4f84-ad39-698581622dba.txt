scalacheck-joda
A helper library for using Joda-Time with ScalaCheck.
Motivation
The library is to help with useful generation of Joda-Time's classes for use with ScalaCheck, giving more control than arbitrary[Long].map(new DateTime(_)):

The granularity of the generated instances, for instance only generating DateTime classes to the nearest minute, and
The period of the generated instances, for instance only generating DateTime classes six months before or after today's date, rather than comparing dates in such a wide range that it is not useful at all.

Todo
(By no means complete)
[x] Control period for DateTime
  [ ] Ability to specify a different period in the past and the future
  [ ] Control granularity for DateTime
  [ ] Package structure
  [ ] Fill out todos for the other types (for both granularity and period where appropriate)
