WAT
Eventhough there is a opnsense tinc plugin already, its hard to keep the GUI offering all the options tinc actual offers.
Be it a infinit amount of subnets, specific modes (switch/hub/routed) or anything else specific to your setup.
So as an alternative this plugins offers you all daemon / startup / interface integration and also some starting point for the configuration while letting you doing whatever you want with your configuration.
BUT NO GUI!!
Rather you edit the files using ssh, pick your favorite tincd howto / setup or even existing setup on copy it over here.
Utilize the full power of tinc
Installation
The version might change, adjust it if fetch fails

create keypairs by runng tincd -n <yournetwork> -K

2. your network configuration and tun device


Edit /usr/local/etc/tinc/yournetwork/tinc.conf set the server you want to connect to and how this server is to be named


Edit /usr/local/etc/tinc/yournetwork/tinc-up and adjust the network/netbitmask

enter the /usr/local/etc/tinc/yournetwork/hosts folder and rename the files according to what you have chosen for youservername and theotherservername - they must match!


enter the public key of the "this server" you find under /usr/local/etc/tinc/yournetwork/ into the according thisservername file and adjust the subnet this server offers (or subnets)


enter the public key of the "other server" into the according theotherservername file and adjust the subnet the other server offers (or subnets)


4. OPNsense Interface/Gateway/Route/FW configuration
Please see this answer for a brief description
Service mangement
to restart the service to 
configctl tincdcustom restart

More then that you have those obvious commands
configctl tincdcustom stop
configctl tincdcustom start
configctl tincdcustom reload

Uninstallation
When you uninstall the plugins, everything you created in /usr/local/etc/tinc will kept in place, so you can reinstall it at any time
Build it yourself / Development
