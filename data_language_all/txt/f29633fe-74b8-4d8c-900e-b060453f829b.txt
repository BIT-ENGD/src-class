Basic Yelp client
This is a headless example of how to implement an OAuth 1.0a Yelp API client. The Yelp API provides an application token that allows applications to make unauthenticated requests to their search API.
Project 3 - Yelppy App
Yelppy is a Yelp search app using the Yelp API.
Time spent: 6 hours spent in total
User Stories
The following required functionality is completed:

[x] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.

The following optional features are implemented:
