About a year after the acquisition of my company Nextgengolf, Inc, I resigned from my job at the parent company PGA of America few months ago.
I am a free agent now and am super excited to work on my ideas. I have been deep into blockchain space for many years and has been mostly nights 
and weekends. Now, I get to work on it full time and am pretty pumped about it. I am excited about my new project https://www.boringcrypto.xyz. You can read
