NAME
wr -- watch files and run a command when they change
SYNOPSIS
wr [-cvV] command [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
wr will watch the set of files and directories specified on the
command line, and run the specified command when any of the files
changes.  For each file operand which is a directory, all the files
in the directory (recursively)  will be watched.
If no files are specified, it's as if you passed "." as the file parameter.
The following options are available:
-c --chime minutes

Write a diagnostic message after minutes have elapsed since last running
a command, to remind you wr is running.  The default is 5 minutes.
Use the value 0 to disable the chime.

-v --verbose

Generate additional diagnostic information.

--exec

Use exec instead of spawn to run the command.

-p --poll seconds

Use a polling file watcher.  The default is to use a non-polling file watcher.
The non-polling file watcher
may have a relatively small maximum number of files it can watch (200),
but the polling file watcher has no maximum.
The polling file
watcher may incur delays between a file changing and the command running,
compared to the non-polling file watcher.

-V

Display the version number and exit.

-? -h

Display help.

EXAMPLES
The following is how to run make when any file in the current directory
changes:
    wr make

More likely you can whittle the list of source files checked a bit.  The
following will run make any file in the src, doc or test directories
changes:
    wr make src doc test

To run a command with arguments, quote the command you want to run.  The
following will run the command "echo a file changed" when any file in the
current directory changes:
    wr "echo a file changed"

DIAGNOSTICS
wr will not normally exit.   Use ctrl-c or equivalent to kill the process
from the command-line.
Diagnostic information from wr will be written to stderr.
ENVIRONMENT
If the current directory has a .wr file in it, that file is assumed
to have the contents of a wr invocation in it.  Options, option/value
pairs, the command to run, and each file to be watched should be
specified on separate lines.
The file may contain blank lines or lines starting with the # character,
which are considered comments.
The stdout and stderr from the command being run are passed directory to
wr's stdout and stderr.  stdin for the command will not be available
for the command.
The command will be run in either spawn or exec mode, as determined by
command-line options.  Here are the differences:
exec:

the command will not be parsed, as will be run as given
should handle i/o redirection shell operators
stdout and stderr output will be buffered until the command is complete

spawn:

the command will be parsed into space separated tokens, probably
misinterpreting any quotes you have in your command
will not handle i/o redirection shell operators
stdout and stderr output will not be buffered
