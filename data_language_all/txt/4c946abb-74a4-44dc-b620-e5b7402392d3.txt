DatasetManager API & endpoints
The DatasetManager provides the following functionalities:


dataset-mgmt/get-data/{dataset URI o ID}/[{query type}]/[{output data format}]/[{sql query on data}] => DatasetData
It retrieves the data of the dataset and allows for options specifying the data format (i.e. JSON, CSV, etc.) of the output, the type of query to be performed (i.e. a bulk operation, a sample, etc.), and a SQL query (other querying languages may be considered for the future) to perform specific queries on the dataset.  There may be simpler version of this endpoint with predefined options.
{dataset URI o ID} can be either the dataset URI or its associated ID.
[{query type}] is optional and specifies the type of data result wanted. For example, bulk will retrieve the entire dataset (access rights to bulk operation should be carefully set), sample will retrieve a 5% sample of the entire dataset, sample10 will retrieve the 10%, sample100R will retrieve the first 100 rows, etc.
[{output data format}] is an optional field specifying the data format the output will have, e.g. json, csv, avro, etc.
[{sql query on data}] is optional and allows to specify a SQL query on the data.


dataset-mgmt/feat-jdbc/{enble/disable}/{dataset URI o ID} => DsFeatReport
API that enable or disable the feature "Expose a JBDC connector for the dataset". It returns an object of type DsFeatReport which contains info on the operation performed.
{enble/disable} it tells to enable or disable the feature.


dataset-mgmt/feat-jdbc/get/{dataset URI o ID} => DsFeatJdbcConn
API that returns a DsFeatJdbcConn object (JSON) that contains info on the JDBC connection exposed by the dataset, if enabled.
{enble/disable} it tells to enable or disable the feature.
