Data Dependent Distributed Machine Learning (DDDML)
A distributed implementation of our data dependent machine learning method. We cluster the data using kmeans++ (without any heuristics to keep the cluster sizes balanced) and we use the FLANN library to find nearest neighbors for dispatch. Each learner trains a one-vs-all classifier using liblinear.
