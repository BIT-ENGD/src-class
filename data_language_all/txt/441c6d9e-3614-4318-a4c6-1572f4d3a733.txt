=== Crafter MOD for MINETEST-C55 ===
by Master Gollum
Introduction:
This is an utility MOD, itself does nothing. Clones the crafting
  definition system to allow new MOD developers to create their
  own craft systems. For example a pottery wheel to do items with
  clay, a mill to produce flour from cereals, etc.
How it works?
  It give you 2 functions crafter.register_craft(craft) and
  crafter.get_craft_result(data). The main difference with the
  default ones is that they are not restricted for the method
  name, you can use whatever name you want and create a new
  family of crafts. They are used exactly as the default ones
  are used, with the exception that register_craft requires
  the method property.
Example:
-- In the list of definitions
crafter.register_craft({
  type = 'pottery',
    output = 'potter:awasome_jar',
    recipe = {
    {'default:clay_lump','default:clay_lump'},
    {'default:clay_lump','default:clay_lump'},
    }
})

-- Inside your the abm of your crafter node
local shape = inv:get_list("shape")
crafter.get_craft_result({method = "pottery", width = 4, items = shape})
