I am tech professional with over 20 years of experience. I have a day job as the CTO of Epion Health.  I've been working in healthcare my whole career and I find it really rewarding.  All the technology that I develop directly helps patients get the best healthcare possible.
I occasionally consult and help lend my technical expertise to other ventures. Please reach out at
