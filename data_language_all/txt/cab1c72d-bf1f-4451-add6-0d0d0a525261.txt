Current Project: wordapi.net.
I finalised my EsLint configuration today and fixed the little bits of code that threw an error due to some newly added rules. You can see the full configuration file here: https://github.com/lyndseybrowning/wordapi.net/blob/master/eslint/rules.js.
I then started looking at supertest for testing my express server. I found a few articles which were really useful:

codeforgeek.com
codementor.io
willi.am

My aim is to get Supertest up and running and validating all API end-points.
Following that, I am going to look at additional frameworks for unit testing. I'd spent a little while researching testing frameworks today but it was all a bit overwhelming. I saw lots of different keywords like Mocha, Chai, Jasmine, Supertest, Buster, Jest, Expresso... Which one should I choose?
Before I choose a unit testing framework, I'm going to look at each in turn and determine which is the best tool for the job.
