OpenCV Julia introduction
Introduction
The OpenCV Julia binding is under development. Now I am focus on wrap OpenCV
data types and APIs manually. 
The current roadmap is(It may have changes during the development):

Wrap some basic data types and APIs of OpenCV, find and verify the wrap
patterm(Almost done).
Reconsturct the wrapper that was wrote in stage 1, try to find a patter that could
  wrap OpenCV automatically through an generation tool.
Write an generation tool, the generation tool take the output of hearder
  parser in Python binding in OpenCV official repo as input.
Test.

How to install
Due to the binding is still under the initial development, the installation step may not
graceful. I will give a easy and graceful installation way for Windows and Linux after I wrote the generation file.
For now, the binding only wrote and tested on Linux 64 bits platform. No
guarantee for other platform.
Exist samples
I have wrote some samples for testing the API that wrapped manually: Calculate
and draw the histogram for a RGB image, blur an image.
Now I will demonstrate how to use the binding to do those things.
There is a test image:

Blur an image
Blur an image is simple, just read an image and call cv::blur.
Here is the code in Julia:

Simply, isn't it?
No suprise, the output is shown below:

Calculate histogram
The code of calculating histogram that use OpenCV Julia binding is like this:

I am sure you can understand the code by reading comments and codes. Here is the
output that generated in Julia by the binding:

For reference, here is the the code write in Python with official OpenCV Python binding:

Output:
