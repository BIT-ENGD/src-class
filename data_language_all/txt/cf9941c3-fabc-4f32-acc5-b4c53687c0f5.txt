A simple yet beautifully architected solution for management of paged-style view controllers.
Dynamic loading of view controllers, allowing handling of high amounts of data without compromising memory.
Highly customisable, all items have clean APIâ€™s to change them to any appearance or size.
Can be sized and positioned anywhere within a view controller.
Made for iPhone and iPad.
Extensively documented code for quick understanding.





Usage

Using SwiftPages in your project is very simple and straightforward. 
Create a SwiftPages Instance
First create your SwiftPages instance, there are two ways to do it, as an IBOoutlet of a view of type SwiftPages from the storyboard, or programmatically:
As an IBOoutlet of a view of type SwiftPages from the storyboard

Place a UIView in your view controller and assign its constraints, make its class be of type SwiftPages. Then control drag to your view controller as an IBOutlet.
As a fully programmatic SwiftPages view.

Declare it in the viewDidLoad function of your view controller and set the desired position and size:
swift
let swiftPagesView : SwiftPages!
swiftPagesView = SwiftPages(frame: CGRectMake(0, 0, self.view.frame.width, self.view.frame.height))
Then, after the initialization (described below), add it as a subview on your view controller:
swift
self.view.addSubview(swiftPagesView)
Initialization
SwiftPages can be initialized in one of two ways:
Initialize with images as buttons on the top bar:

First create an array of strings, the strings will be the Storyboard ID's of the view controllers you would like to include:
swift
var VCIDs : [String] = ["FirstVC", "SecondVC", "ThirdVC", "FourthVC", "FifthVC"]
Then create an array of UIImages which will correlate in order to the VC ID's array created above, it also has to have the same number of items as the aforementioned array:
swift
var buttonImages : [UIImage] = [UIImage(named:"HomeIcon.png")!,
                                        UIImage(named:"LocationIcon.png")!,
                                        UIImage(named:"CollectionIcon.png")!,
                                        UIImage(named:"ListIcon.png")!,
                                        UIImage(named:"StarIcon.png")!]
Finally, use the initializeWithVCIDsArrayAndButtonImagesArray function with the two arrays created:
swift
swiftPagesView.initializeWithVCIDsArrayAndButtonImagesArray(VCIDs, buttonImagesArray: buttonImages)
Initialize with text on buttons:

First, alike with the image initialization, create an array of strings, the strings will be the Storyboard ID's of the view controllers you would like to include:
swift
var VCIDs : [String] = ["FirstVC", "SecondVC", "ThirdVC", "FourthVC", "FifthVC"]
Then create an array of titles which will correlate in order to the VC ID's array created above, it must have the same number of items as the aforementioned array:
swift
var buttonTitles : [String] = ["Home", "Places", "Photos", "List", "Tags"]
Finally, use the initializeWithVCIDsArrayAndButtonTitlesArray function with the two arrays created:
swift
swiftPagesView.initializeWithVCIDsArrayAndButtonTitlesArray(VCIDs, buttonTitlesArray: buttonTitles)
Customisation

Once you have your SwiftPages instance you can customize the appearance of all item's using the class API's, to view the API list look for the API's Mark on the SwiftPages class. Below is a brief customization sample:
swift
swiftPagesView.enableAeroEffectInTopBar(true)
swiftPagesView.setButtonsTextColor(UIColor.whiteColor())
swiftPagesView.setAnimatedBarColor(UIColor.whiteColor())
Example

You can find a full example on usage and customization on the Xcode project attached to this repository.
