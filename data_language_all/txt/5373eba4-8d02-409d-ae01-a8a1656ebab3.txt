Github Issues CLI
⚠️ No longer maintained ⚠️
The current version allows you to fetch or upload Github issues. fetch lets
you store the retrieved issues in CSV or JSON. upload lets you create
multiple issues from a CSV.
In short
Fetch issues
Get all issues from ustwo/ustwo.com-frontend labelled as in_backlog or
bug and store them as CSV in ustwo.csv.
sh
github-issues fetch ustwo/ustwo.com-frontend \
                    --oauth-token=$GITHUB_TOKEN \
                    --format=csv \
                    --output=usweb.csv \
                    --label=in_backlog \
                    --label=bug
Upload issues
Create a file myissues.csv with the following format:
csv
title,body,labels,assignees,milestone_id
"A nice title","A descriptive body","in_backlog,feature",arnau,1
"Another issue","foo bar","chore",,
And run
sh
github-issues upload ustwo/ustwo.com-frontend \
                     --oauth-token=$GITHUB_TOKEN \
                     --input=myissues.csv
The order of the fields is fixed: title, body, labels, assignees,
milestone_id. And title is the only required field so the minimum record
possible is:
csv
A title,,,,
Another title,,,,
As you can see, the header line is optional. The fields are identified and
consumed in order:

title
body
labels
assignees
milestone_id

Note: Github allows you to create labels by just setting them in a new Issue
but it will fail if you reference a non-existing milestone id.
The output in the screen will be showing the progress like this:
Info: Created issue number 18 A nice title
Info: Created issue number 19 Another issue
And it will reflect an error like:
Error: Couldn't create an issue for 'Foo bar' because the field 'milestone' has an invalid value.
Check for duplicates
If you want to check if any record in the CSV you are about to upload is a
possible duplicate to an existing issue you can pass the flag --check to
the upload command. This flag makes the command noop so even if there are
no duplicates detected you'll have to run the upload command without the
flag in order to create new issues.
The current duplicate detection is quite naive. It only checks if the title
of the issue is similar to another one. So short names have more chances to
be false positives.
Install
The preferred way to install github-issues is via Hombrew:
sh
brew install ustwo/tools/github-issues
Alternatively, grab a release
and place it in your $PATH.
