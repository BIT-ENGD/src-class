Swift Experiments
This is intended to be a collection of small Swift apps I wrote and find
useful. They might be used by others as examples or maybe somebody finds
them useful in other ways.
TeaTime
This is a really small timer application. On start, the application hides
itself (so that it stays out of the way) and shows a three minute countdown
in the menu extra. When the three minutes are over, it activates itself and
shows a dialog that the tea is ready.
The icon is taken from
http://www.iconfinder.com/icondetails/1393/128/coffee_cup_hot_tea_icon.
Interesting classes used:

NSTimer
NSStatusBar
