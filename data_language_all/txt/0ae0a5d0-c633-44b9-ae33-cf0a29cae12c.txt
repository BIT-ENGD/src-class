profile
Using the Puppet Roles and Profiles design pattern, this module defines profiles that can be combined into roles for application to nodes.
Profiles:
* Define logical technology stacks
* Provide an area to add cross-module functionality such as resource chaining
* Allow modules to remain granular and secular
We achieve maximal separation by using Hiera and Puppet 3's parameter binding to define almost all parameter configuration.
