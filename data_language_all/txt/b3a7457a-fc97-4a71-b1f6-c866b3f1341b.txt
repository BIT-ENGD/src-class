Wintersmith Docker image!
Clone and build Wintersmith to get started!
Basic instructions and usage can be found at the repo base: https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith 
I personally built within a Docker image, then extracted the skeleton build afterwards. I really didn't want to install any dependencies on this system.
But if you don't mind configuring nodejs in your environment, a typical build is fine too.

Need to update your blog? Simply edit your content in static/contents/ per Wintersmith style guide. 
Then, rebuild your Docker image, and deploy the new version!
The resulting Docker image is very small: nginx and static files only on Alpine! No binaries or node_modules hanging around.
I will make a blog post about this explaining what else can be done with this template, and how it can be deployed, once I deploy this to my own space online :D

Todo: Better Nginx configuration with more examples of usage; right now it is barebones just for static site.
Todo: Script/Dockerfiles showing how to do initial build to get skeleton
Todo: Flesh out .Dockerignore file
Todo: Practice using Markdown...
