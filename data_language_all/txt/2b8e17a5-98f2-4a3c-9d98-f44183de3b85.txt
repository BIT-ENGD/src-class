About
The CLI tool is a simple reference project designed to be run from a command line.
It demonstrates the use of CMake as build tool, Boost as external dependency, 
Gflags and GoogleTeset as external dependencies that are optionally downloaded and compiled during the build process,
and GoogleTest as the main testing framework. Doxygen is used for documentation (integrated with CMake).
Building
This project uses typical cmake out-of-source build pattern:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

Documentation
The make file generated by CMake should have a doc target which you can use to
generate documentation. The documentation is placed under <build-dir>/html. To
generate docs,
make doc
google-chrome html/index.html

Testing
After building, you can run the tests either by running the test executable or, in the build directory, by issuing:
make check
