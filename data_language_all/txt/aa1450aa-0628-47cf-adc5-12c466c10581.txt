gidTest
gidTest is a simplistic test framework for Gideros Mobile applications
Goals

Support TDD within Gideros Studio
Give fast visual feedback

How to use

Clone the project
Open the gidTest.proj file in Gideros Studio
Start the Gideros Player
Run the Project

This shows something like this in the output window:
gidTest tests: 3
------------------------------
test_type: Succeeded
test_true: Succeeded
test_false:
* This test fails (assertEquals: actual:true, expected:false)
* Failed
------------------------------
Result: Failed (2/3)

Also a transparant square will be drawn in the application, showing the state of the testsuite, either red of green.
Work in progress
Committed an initial version, now I am going to work with it and see what it grows into.
Be warned: In its current state gidTest is a very incomplete framework and work in progress.
Continuous Integration
You can use the 'gdrbridge.exe' tool from Gideros to start the project against a player (which you can also start from the command line)
This means that it should be possible to run your tests from a CI server like Jenkins
