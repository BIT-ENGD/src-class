Coding conventions

For files underneath bin:

Use - as separator for filenames (like
     my-nice-cool-script).


Do not use extensions for the used language (so no trailing
     .sh, and no trailing .py)


At least for programs that “act on” refinery, filenames should
     start in refinery-.


For files outside of bin:


Use _ as separator for filenames (like
    my_nice_file.txt).


Do use proper extensions there. (like trailing .xml, or
    trailing .properties)


We do not like camelCase in variable names. Only use them in Java
  code, where they are somewhat standard, and in Python class names.


Filenames for files in HiveQL should end in .hql.


When referencing tables, reference them using database.table
  wherever possible.


For Hadoop jobs, use the “adhoc” queue per default, and make sure
  that it can be overridden to submit the job to queues with less
  limitations.


For Oozie jobs, set oozie.use.system.libpath, and
  oozie.action.external.stats.write to true in the
  corresponding properties files. (This setting will get added as
  default at some point, but until then, we rely on it being set in
  the properties files)


When needing to reference hdfs, try using hdfs:///. Where this
  does not work, try using hdfs://analytics-hadoop/, then
  hdfs://namenode.analytics.eqiad.wmnet/ and finally
  hdfs://namenode.analytics.eqiad.wmnet:8020/.


Use 4 spaces to indent files.


There is no rule on vertical alignment.


In HiveQL, we prefer != over <>.


In XML, put the beginning and ending tag on separate lines for
  multi-lined element values. So use

    foo
    bar
  


instead of
  <tag>foo
  bar</tag>

.


For Oozie jobs, have the name end in -wf for workflows,
  -coord for coordinators, and -bundle for bundles.


If you add Oozie jobs, update the diagrams/oozie-overview.dia.
