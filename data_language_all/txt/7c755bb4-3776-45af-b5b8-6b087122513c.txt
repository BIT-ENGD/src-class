Hammertime Panel
Extended moderation for your vanilla server
Currently allows for : 
- Caps protection
- Player movement warning broadcasting to server operators
- - Kick for flying, optional moved wrongly
- Simple callvote for permitted players
- Word filter - both whole word and part of word detection
- - Fully configurable
- IP tracking - notification when IPs of 2 players match
- - IP blacklist for persistent people
- - - Warning only by default, supports bash scripting for people who want to be special

This is still a work in progress.
