FrenziedRegenerationHelper
Note regarding future development of this addon
Since World of Warcraft patch 8.0.1, Frenzied Regeneration no longer works this way, and so this addon is no longer useful (and very likely will not even work). Since it's no longer useful, I will no longer be updating it. Should Frenzied Regeneration's mechanics return to this one day, I will resume development.
What is this?
FrenziedRegenerationHelper is a small UI addon for World of Warcraft, which displays approximately how much health Frenzied Regeneration will heal for.
As of patch 7.0.3, Frenzied Regeneration does the following:

Heals you for 50% of all damage taken in the last 5 sec over 3 sec, minimum 5% of maximum health. 

The game does not tell you how much health this actually is, so it can be difficult to guage how much Frenzied Regeneration will actually heal you for. This addon will estimate that value for you and display it in a small movable window. The window automatically hides when not in bear form, and won't display if you are not a druid in guardian spec with access to the Frenzied Regeneration ability. The value is an estimate only, but in most cases should be extremely close to the actual value.
Installing
Downloaded from Curse
If you've downloaded the zip file from Curse, installating should be as easy as unpacking the zip file directly into your "Interface\Addons" directory, just like any other addon.
Downloaded from bitbucket
If you've downloaded this from bitbucket, you can unpack the zip file  directly into your addons directory as well, but you must rename the folder that it creates to "FrenziedRegenerationHelper", or it will not work (WOW addon folder names must match the name of the .toc file).
