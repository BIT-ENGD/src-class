Iago Echo Example
This is the README for an example usage of Iago. This brings up an echo server on your localhost,
then creates an Iago job to send traffic to your server.
If you are unfamiliar with how to use Iago, check out src & echo-loadtest.sh. Also read the Iago2 documentation.
Build Iago
mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
Build the example
cd examples/echo
mvn package
Start the Echo Server
sh -evx src/scripts/echo-server.sh
Run Iago
sh -evx src/scripts/echo-loadtest.sh
