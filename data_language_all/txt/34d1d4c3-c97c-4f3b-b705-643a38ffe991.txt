geojson-topojson
Note: FYI, there's a far nicer geojson -> topojson converter at distillery (although it doesn't do topojson -> geojson).
A simple (perhaps dumb) web interface to quickly convert between GeoJSON and TopoJSON. Basically, a web interface for Mike Bostock's topojson library.
Use
Available online at jeffpaine.github.io/geojson-topojson/.
Why
So folks can just use a simple web interface to quickly convert some data without having to install anything. Perhaps as a first step to trying out TopoJSON.
Users looking to convert lots of data programmatically should use the topojson library locally (directions).
Limitations

Don't convert back and forth between formats multiple times as -> TopoJSON will lose precision via quantization and -> GeoJSON drops topology
