Constraints on the instruments table
To enforce consistent conventions in the instruments table, there are some
supporting tables that list the allowed values for an associated column in the
instruments table.
instrumentkinds table
This table, consisting of one column kind, lists the different kinds of
instruments that may be used in a measurement. More values can be added manually
via a database query or via the instrumentkinds.json setup file to accommodate
new instrument types.
