Console Tic-Tac-Toe
I wrote a console command line version of Tic Tac Toe in Ruby and Scala.
The game always starts off as you are X, and then you play against the AI.
When the game ends, you switch marks (you become O, etc).
Upon a new game, you switch sides and play O and so on and so forth.
The AI is using alpha-beta pruning for it's minimax tree.
Play
To run the game, clone this repo, and then run:
ruby game.rb
Scala
Build the scala files and run the Game object.
Purpose of this game

Learning basic Ruby
Learning basic Scala
Learning basic AI and game theory
