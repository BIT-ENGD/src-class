Unexpected Experiments
Repository for my games made for the Experimental Gameplay Prototype project.
This finality of this project is to create several prototypes each based on a
different random topic. 
This games prototypes are to be completed created in an extremely short time:
5 days. At such, it is to be expected that the prototypes get better
throughout the iterations as I get the hang of developing in a fast pace.
Here is a brief description of each game developed so far, plus some
statistics. See each prototype source or the project homepage for more
information.
01) Ecosystem - The Blob
The idea was to be an alien "blob" that had to conquer each planet in a solar
system before he ran out of biomass. Each planet had a different ecosystem,
and as such, could provide better or worse conditions for the blob. The
prototype was extremely incomplete at the end of the iterations.
Developed in LÃ¶ve 2D (Lua engine). First time developing in this
language/engine.
Implementation time: 27 hours (~2.5 days of work)
Total iteration time: 50 hours (~5 days of work)
02) Imaginary - Bob
The idea was to show an office worker in his un-motivating office,
where every aspect of it was depressing and made him feel bad. After this, we
would see him retreat into his imaginary world, where he would live his
passions, as a way of escapism. You explore this reality as a point n' click
game. Sadly, due to time restraints, only part of the office was implemented. 
Developed in Construct 2.
Implementation time: 6 days of work
Total iteration time: 7 days of work
