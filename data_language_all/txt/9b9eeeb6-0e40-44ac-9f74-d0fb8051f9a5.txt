* q_booking_agency_total: total number of booked passengers for the agency, the competition and the whole market
* q_booking_agency_evolution: timeserie of the number of booked passengers for the agency, the competition and the whole market.
* q_booking_agency_onds: top 50 origin-destination pairs according to the number of booked passengers for the agency type given in sort_by on the last period given in booking_period or departure_period.
* q_booking_agency_airlines: top 50 marketing carriers according to the number of booked passengers for the agency type given in sort_by on the last period given in booking_period or departure_period.
* q_booking_agency_countries: top 20 point of sale countries according to the number of booked passengers for the agency type given in sort_by on the last period given in booking_period or departure_period.
Parameters
Passenger bookings are analyzed over a period of time, either the booking time (time the booking was performed) or the departure time.
One of the two following parameters must be given:
* booking_period: to select the bookings that were performed during a period
* departure_period: to select the bookings for flights leaving during a period
This parameters can take either a year (yyyy), a quarter (yyyy-Qq, eg. 2012-Q1), a month (yyyy-mm), a week (yyyy-Www, eg. 2012-W42) or, for departure_period only, a day (yyyy-mm-dd).
To compare bookings over different periods, these parameters accept several values.
For instance to compare bookings made in February 2013 with bookings made in February 2012, pass the parameter ?booking_period=2012-02,2013-02.
It is possible to consider only the beginnign of a period with the following parameter:

limit_in_days: number of days to consider from the start of the period.

This is useful to compare the bookings of the current month with the bookings on the previous year.
For instance to compare the bookings made in February 2013 from the 1st to the 10th with the bookings made in February 2012 on the same period, pass the parameters : ?booking_period=2012-02,2013-02&limit_in_days=10.
The following optional parameters can be specified to filter the search:
* origin_city, origin_port, origin_country: IATA code of the departure city, departure airport or departure country of the O&D respectively
* destination_city, destination_port, destination_country : IATA code of the arrival city, arrival airport or arrival country of the O&D respectively
* pos_oid: office id of the point of sale
* pos_country: country IATA code of the point of sale
* marketing_carrier: IATA code of the marketing carrier
* cabin_class: 1-letter code for the cabin class
* sort_by: agency types taken as sort criterion for top_onds, top_airlines and top_countries. It is one of the agency types (ie. either travel_agency, competition or market), default value is travel_agency
* limit: number of results to output (max allowed value: 1000, default: 50)
* offset: rank of the first result to output (to be used in combination with limit to retrieve results by chunks)
