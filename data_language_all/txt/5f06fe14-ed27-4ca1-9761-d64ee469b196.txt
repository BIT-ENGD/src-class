vcpkg_extract_source_archive
Extract an archive into the source directory.
Usage
cmake
vcpkg_extract_source_archive(
    <${ARCHIVE}> [<${TARGET_DIRECTORY}>]
)
Parameters
ARCHIVE
The full path to the archive to be extracted.
This is usually obtained from calling vcpkg_download_distfile.
TARGET_DIRECTORY
If specified, the archive will be extracted into the target directory instead of ${CURRENT_BUILDTREES_DIR}\src\.
This can be used to mimic git submodules, by extracting into a subdirectory of another archive.
Notes
This command will also create a tracking file named .extracted in the TARGET_DIRECTORY. This file, when present, will suppress the extraction of the archive.
Examples

libraw
protobuf
msgpack
