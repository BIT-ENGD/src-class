BikeApp
This app is my first iOS developed using Swift.
I made it for APIDaysSF conference on 13-15th of June 2014 at Parisoma.
I gave a lighting talk about this project, you can find the slide here
What does it do ?
Find the nearest public bikes stations with bikes available. It's working in the Bay Area, and the data is coming from the BayArea Bike Share API available here 
I used APItools to reduce the payload and extract the data I needed
