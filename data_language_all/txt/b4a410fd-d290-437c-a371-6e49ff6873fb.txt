Raspberry Pi 3 Rust Starter Template
How to use this:


Install the aarch64-none-elf toolchain.

On Linux, download the linaro toolchain. Add bin/ to your $PATH.
On Mac: brew tap SergioBenitez/osxct && brew install aarch64-none-elf.



Install Rust nightly.
Assuming you have rustup installed, this is as easy as rustup default nightly.


Install Xargo.
sh
 rustup component add rust-src
 cargo install xargo


You can now call:

make: creates build/template.{a,elf,hex.bin}
