r3-mode
REBOL3 editing mode for Emacs v 0.003
This is a very preliminary release, put up only because it has slightly better highlighting than rebol.el when it comes to r3 code, and a couple of small useful features. There certainly errors, and under-construction features. Use at your own risk, and please be very aggressive about reporting any bugs.
New Stuff

Source mode now evaluates the edited code on C-x C-s (it doesn't add a write-file hook, so you can still save the definition to a local file if you like)
Help mode is now minimally highlighted and supports the help and source keys (C-c C-h/C-c h for help, C-c C-s/C-c s for source). I won't be doing buttoning because it was producing stupid results (such as buttonifying the word if regardless of context)
the r3 REPL is now highlighted in the same manner as r3 code buffers
r3-help now correctly selects words like object? and map! (it previously dropped punctuation)

Installation

clone this repository
add the following to your ~/.emacs file:

(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/this/repo")
(autoload 'r3-mode "r3-mode.el" "Major mode for REBOL3 development" t)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.r$" . r3-mode)) ;; *.r files will be opened in r3-mode

run M-x customize-group r3 and change the variable r3-rebol-command to point at your r3 interpreter

Features

C-c C-h or C-c h: display help on the word at point in a separate buffer
C-c C-s or C-c s: display the source code for the word at point in a separate buffer
run-r3: starts up an r3 prompt as a comint buffer
C-c C-c: evaluates the highlighted region into the running r3 prompt

Features under construction

Argument Hints Currently dummied out; the mode will eventually offer argument hints in the minibuffer as you type.
Jump-To-Definition Self explanatory, I hope.
