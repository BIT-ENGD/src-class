SR(A)WN 2016 — 22
This is the twenty second issue of the 2016 Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter, a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings‐on across Student Robotics. Emboldened items are ones which we believe could do with extra hands. An absence of emboldening does not necessarily mean that everything is done.
Only two days to go until the competition!


Media consent forms have been processed by a number of volunteers.
Kit stored in Southampton has been moved to Newbury for the competition.
Work has been done on improving the Student Robotics competition software to suit the next competition.
The committee has created a tree of links to documents for the operations manual for all documentation in the future.


Thanks to everyone who helped put this issue together. If you would like, you can also read the previous issue.
