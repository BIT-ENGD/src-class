How to generate documentation:
DESCRIPTION
To generate documentation:
1) Start by filling out the 'man-template.md'
2) Then use a program ronn. Get ronn from github.
3) Run ronn:
$ ronn <filename>.md
4)  Remember, we use the following naming convention for files:
git-<command>.html
git-<command>.1
git-<command>.md
You'll need to rename the html file, as ronn probably inserted a 1 into the filename.
EXAMPLE

SHELL SCRIPT
Alternatively you can run the manning-up.sh automated shell script included in the man folder. The script will recreate the git-work index based on the list of .md files available before it runs ronn against each one to generate the documents as well as renaming the generated .html files to their desired form.
$ ./manning-up.sh
To only (re)generate a specific .md manual template and have .1.html renamed to .html yau may also use manning-up.sh.
$ ./manning-up.sh git-info.md
