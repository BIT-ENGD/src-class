SR(A)WN 2015 â€” 9
This is the ninth issue of the Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter, a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings-on across SR. If you have feedback or think we've missed something, feel free to reply to this thread. Emboldened items are ones which we believe could do with extra hands. An absence of emboldening does not necessarily mean that everything is done.
