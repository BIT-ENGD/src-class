Book progress
A simple meteorjs reference application, loosely based on
meteor-todo. Keeps track on
your reading progress for multiple books simultaneously, so you don't have to.
Quick start
$ curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh # Install meteorjs, if you haven't already
$ git clone git@github.com:CarlEkerot/book-progress.git
$ cd book-progress
$ meteor
