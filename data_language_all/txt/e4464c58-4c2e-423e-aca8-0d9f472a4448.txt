In this exercise, you will look at an equity index and plot it for a particular range of dates.
The data used in this exercise and in the rest of the course are contained in the package qrmdata. You also need the package xts to manipulate time series.
When the qrmdata library is attached, as it will be throughout the course, you can load a dataset with the data() command. For example, the command data("FTSE") loads the UK FTSE (Financial Times Stock Exchange) index, which you can then refer to as object FTSE.
will you
If you want to extract the data from a certain date range, for example from April 1 to June 30, 2000, you can create a new object using the command ftse00 <- FTSE["2000-04-01/2000-06-30"].
From now onwards, the xts package will also already be loaded into your workspace.
