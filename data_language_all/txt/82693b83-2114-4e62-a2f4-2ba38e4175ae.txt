crowdup
crowdup is a project for anyone who wants to easily update their app translations files from Crowdin that helps update translations via a simple command line interface.
This project is early in development and a work in progress. Please file issues!
Demo
Configure crowdup, then run crowdup update and watch the magic happen!

About
crowdup matches translation files purely based on filename. For instance, ../archive/en/en-US.json will be matched with ../i18n/translated/en-US.json and so forth. This might not work best for everyone; feel free to send a pull request to satisfy your scenario.
Features:
* Gives users the ability to overwrite existing web app translations with those from Crowdin
* Users can build then download via the Crowdin API directly, or point crowdup at downloaded translations
* Users have the option to look over files to update and abort without modifying anything if something looks wrong
* crowdup stores user configurations, so updating translations in the future is super fast
* Check status of translations in Crowdin
Coming soon:
* Detect translation matches based on subfolders where translation filenames are identical
* Ability to map translation files from archive to specific translation file locations
* Ability to ignore files
* Detect if files need to be updated or not
* Better error detection and logging

$ crowdup --help
Use with Crowdin API
Run crowdup config and add your app's translation directory, Crowdin API key, and Crowdin project identifier. For example:
$ crowdup config
crowdup: full path to app translations:  /Users/daniel/Projects/webapp/app/i18n
crowdup: crowdin api key found in account at crowdin.com:  37cb230570eb0bd1bc00860ff42c1ba3
crowdup: crowdin project id found in account at crowdin.com:  my_project
saved crowdup configuration to /Users/daniel/.crowdup
Now you can update translations on demand with:
$ crowdup update
Use with downloaded Crowdin files
Don't want to use the Crowdin API? No problem. Point crowdup at your Crowdin translation download (either the .ZIP or directory) and at your app translations directory:
$ crowdup update -c ~/Downloads/crowdin-translations.zip -a ~/Projects/webapp/app/i18n/
Check status of translations
Easily check the status of your translations with:
$ crowdup status
