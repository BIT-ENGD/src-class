open189-rs     

A Rust client for the open.189.cn (天翼开放平台) API.
Documentation is available at docs.rs. I might translate all of
the docs to Chinese, as the service is largely useless for anyone outside of
Mainland China, but since the i18n story of rustdoc isn't really told yet,
I decided to postpone this.
License
open189-rs is licensed the same as Rust: dual Apache 2.0 and MIT. See
LICENSE-Apache and LICENSE-MIT for details.
Usage
Check out the docs or the examples/ directory to
learn how to use the library. You can send verification codes with SMS to
mobile phones in Mainland China with this library, actually it's almost what the
whole API service is all about. (The API has more features beyond SMS sending,
but people are hardly making use of any of those. That's another ~~rant~~ story,
on how the Chinese IT industry got so fragmented, with so many vendors trying
to build an omni-platform once and for all, instead of focusing on where each
vendor excels.)
Changelog
