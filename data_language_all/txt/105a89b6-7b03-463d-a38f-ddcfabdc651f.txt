1.0.0 (2012/01/01)

The first public and stable release after two more years development!

We did lots of changes in this release, suggest you to read the README once again.
But I would like to list those abandon key binding from old versions:
  *  "d" is not supported to close current tab now. use "dc" for that.
 (Because we have added some hotkeys started with "d".  "dc", "dm", "do", "dl", "dr", "dp", "dP". refer Features for detail)



<Esc> is not supported to enable Vrome after disabled it with <C-z>. use <C-Esc> (Control+Esc) for that.
(Because <Esc> is used much often than <C-Esc>)
