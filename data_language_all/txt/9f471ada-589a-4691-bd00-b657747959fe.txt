Vibration

A plugin for handling Vibration API on iOS, Android, and web. API docs.
Getting Started


Add vibration to the dependencies section of pubspec.yaml.
yml
dependencies:
  vibration: ^1.7.3


Import package:
dart
import 'package:vibration/vibration.dart';


Methods
hasVibrator
Check if the target device has vibration capabilities.
dart
if (await Vibration.hasVibrator()) {
    Vibration.vibrate();
}
hasAmplitudeControl
Check if the target device has the ability to control the vibration amplitude,
introduced in Android 8.0 Oreo - false for all earlier API levels.
dart
if (await Vibration.hasAmplitudeControl()) {
    Vibration.vibrate(amplitude: 128);
}
hasCustomVibrationsSupport
Check if the device is able to vibrate with a custom duration, pattern or intensity.
May return true even if the device has no vibrator (if you want to check whether the device has a vibrator,
see hasVibrator).
dart
if (await Vibration.hasCustomVibrationsSupport()) {
    Vibration.vibrate(duration: 1000);
} else {
    Vibration.vibrate();
    await Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 500));
    Vibration.vibrate();
}
vibrate
With specific duration (for example, 1 second):
dart
Vibration.vibrate(duration: 1000);
Default duration is 500ms. 
With specific duration and specific amplitude (if supported):
dart
Vibration.vibrate(duration: 1000, amplitude: 128);
With pattern (wait 500ms, vibrate 1s, wait 500ms, vibrate 2s):
dart
Vibration.vibrate(pattern: [500, 1000, 500, 2000]);
With pattern (wait 500ms, vibrate 1s, wait 500ms, vibrate 2s) at varying intensities (1 - min, 255 - max):
dart
Vibration.vibrate(pattern: [500, 1000, 500, 2000], intensities: [1, 255]);
cancel
Stop ongoing vibration.
dart
Vibration.cancel();
Android
The VIBRATE permission is required in AndroidManifest.xml.
xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE"/>
Supports vibration with duration and pattern. On Android 8 (Oreo) and above, uses the VibrationEffect class.
For the rest of the usage instructions, see Vibrator class documentation.
iOS
Supports vibration with duration and pattern on CoreHaptics devices. On older devices, the pattern is emulated with 500ms long vibrations.
You can check whether the current device has CoreHaptics support using hasCustomVibrationsSupport.
