video-scripts
The content of this repo can be read from its
github.io page.
For now, this contains the script for a single video, Learn Lua in an Hour.
I made a git repo for video scripts because I'd like to invite people to collaboratively
suggest improvements. This model is somewhere between a wikipedia page and emailing
suggestions to the author of a textbook. I retain more control over the script than
a wikipedia author, but I hope to be more responsive than a textbook author!
I invite pull requests with script changes that:

keep the script length about the same (or shorter!),
keep the spirit and scope of the material about the same, and
improve either the clarity or correctness of the material.

My plan is to eventually add a few more video scripts here as well.
