Colors Repo

This repo is a small subset of my colour collection for Github
Keep it simple, generally only using 9 colors. There are a few with some bolds  
There's a color file seperate from .Xresources for cleaner switching. Include the file with 
    #include </path/to/crayolo/colors/[file]>
Added matching walls directory
Random color script will display associated wall if exists, else a pattern wall using colors from xrdb

Implementation

Use below in your .Xresources file 
  
Miscellaneous

Added tile.xbm to the repo [IIRC, I got this off of dcat's github at some point]
Implementation Example xetroot -bitmap $walls/tile.xbm -bg "$(xrdb -query | grep  "*background" | awk '{print $2}')" -fg "$(xrdb -query | grep  "*foreground" | awk '{print $2}')"
use random color picker to get a different color at each wm-start. Place in .xinitrc, or wm config, I suppose
Find me on linuxbbq, forum or IRC on freenode (I'm a weekend warrior)
