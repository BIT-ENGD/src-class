Emacs Search Kit
Just a small toolkit that helps emacs users to find files by either
their names or patterns in their contents.
How to use it
First of all, clone our repo to somewhere
bash
$ git clone https://github.com/clarete/emacs-search-kit.git esk
Now, edit your .emacs and add the following lines
lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/your/esk/clone")
(require 'esk)
Finally, you're ready to use it. Just do M-x esk-find-file or
M-x esk-find-in-project.
It's also a good idea to bind these functions to a keyboard
shortcut. The following commands will do this job:
lisp
(global-set-key "\M-s" 'esk-find-file)
(global-set-key "\M-\S-s" 'esk-find-in-project)
