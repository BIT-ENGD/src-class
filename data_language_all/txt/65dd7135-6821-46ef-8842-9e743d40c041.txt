Note taking process

Notes are taken using pandoc markdown extended syntax
Check Adam cheatsheet or Wikipedia for more information and useful tips


Using pandoc, the notes are converted into a eye-candy pdf, using tex as an intermediary file type
The latex compiler used is xelatex
The Eisvogel template is used with small modifications


Using an yaml header, some metadata and rendering options are provided
Some of the used diagrams are generated using either dot or timing-tikz. The remaining were copied from the course slides.

DOT & Grphviz
The dot graph description language is a graphic description language, enable the fast creation of reasonably neat diagrams
For interpreting the dot code, graphviz as used.
For more information on dot and graphviz, check out this amazing guide
Timing-Tikz
A subset of the Latex vector graphic language, Tikz, that uses geometric/algebric description to create beatiful diagrams
Timing-tikz is a package specific for the generation of timing diagrams, such as digital signals.

From markdown to pdf
To provide a rapid view of the output pdf, two bash script are available in the scripts folder 

Publishing
To ease the publish of an eye-candy pdf:

Acknowledgement
This work is a direct product of the lectures notes toked during Operative Systems classes in the academic year of 2017/18, lectured by Prof. Artur Pereira. 
This raw notes were later improved and filtered using as scientific reference the lecture slides from Prof. Artur Pereira and the book Modern Operating Systems by Andrew Tanenbaum & Herbert Bos
