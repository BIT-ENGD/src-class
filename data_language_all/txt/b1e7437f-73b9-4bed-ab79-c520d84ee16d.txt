docker-aws-iot-demo

Lightweight demo of AWS IoT messaging from a Docker container

Getting started
Most of this is based on this guide
Prerequisites
1) Install node
2) Install git
3) Install yarn
4) Install Docker
Set up project
1) Start Docker on your computer
2) Clone this repo
bash
git clone https://github.com/thegreatsunra/docker-aws-iot-demo.git
cd docker-aws-iot-demo
Set up AWS IoT
1) Sign up for AWS
2) Go to the AWS IoT home screen
3) Go to your Registry of Things
4) Create a new Thing
5) Name your Thing
Create an AWD IoT "Thing" certificate
1) Choose "Security" from the menu
2) Click "Create Certificate"
3) Download "A certificate for this thing"
4) Download "A public key"
5) Download "A private key"
6) Download "A root CA for AWS IoT from Symantec"
7) Click the "Activate" button
8) Click "Done"
Associate certificates with your project
1) Move all the files you downloaded (the certificate, public key, private key, and root CA) from AWS IoT into the certs/ folder of this project, and rename the files to certificate.pem.crt, public.pem.key, private.pem.key, and root-CA.crt
2) Open package.json and find the start script (should be around line 30)
Build and run the container
1) Build the Docker container
bash
docker build --no-cache -t <your_username>/docker-aws-iot-demo .
2) Run the container in detached mode
bash
docker run -d <your_username>/docker-aws-iot-demo
3) When you run the above command, Docker will output a long hexidecimal string. This is your <container_id>
4) Run docker logs <container_id> to make sure your Docker container successfully started up
Confirm messages are streaming to AWS IoT
1) With your Docker container running, go to your AWS IoT home screen and click the "Test" menu option
2) Under "Subscribe to a topic" enter awsIotDemo as your "Subscription topic"
3) Click "Subscribe to topic"
4) Click the "awsIotDemo" menu item that appears beneath "Subscribe to a topic" in the left menu
5) You should see messages streaming in!
6) Run docker stop <container_id> to stop the container
