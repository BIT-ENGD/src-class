Hadoop Watcher
Main goal
Keedio's Hadoop Watcher is a functionality for watching hdfs paths for changes. When a change occurs in the observed directory a event is fired. All listeners subscribed to the event generator will be notified.
Description
Hadoop-Watcher is intended for monitoring simple actions over the files of a hdfs directory. It just monitors the account files and modification times without worrying about which file has been affected, only if at least one it has been, reason enough to inform listeners to do something accordingly, for example. re-read directory data observed.
If you are interested in a similar solution but you need to know exactly which file has been affected by a change, visit Keedio's VFS2-Monitor
How To Use
Normally a object interested in events (listener) from a path to be watched should instance WatchablePath with:

String path to be watched.
Hadoop config.
Start time in seconds.
Periodic time in seconds.
Regexp for matching files.

The listener will have to register himself to the watchable object and will implement what to do, when something happens in the monitored path.
The path will be checked periodically for new files or changes in its modification times.
If the path contains subpaths, changes under subdirectories will all be watched.
