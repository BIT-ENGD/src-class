Container initialization
This library provides a macro for initializing any container implementing
FromIterator.

A Perl-ish sugar for pairs is also available:
rust
let h: HashMap<_, _> = container! {
    1 => 'x',
    2 => 'y',
};
Iterator literals
container! is built on top of an "iterator literal" macro:
rust
let mut it = literator!['x', 'y', 'z'];
assert_eq!(it.next(), Some('x'));
assert_eq!(it.next(), Some('y'));
literator! works without heap allocation. The elements are moved into a
fixed-size array and then back out during iteration. Currently it supports up
to 32 entries.  Once variadic
generics are available, there should be no limit.
