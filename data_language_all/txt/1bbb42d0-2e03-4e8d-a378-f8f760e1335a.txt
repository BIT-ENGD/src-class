Lightning JSON Feed (lx-json-feed)
This crate supplies a JSON Feed v1.1 implementation as part of the lightning-rs static site generator. Right now, this crate is not published independently, because (among other things) it's still a work in progress. Should that change, I'll consider publishing it.
Prior art
There is an existing Rust crate, jsonfeed, which provides similar functionality. However, it is "still alpha" as of May 2017 and I wanted to be able to work quickly and make changes easily so that I could just get Lightning working.
