tagcicsbundle
Script to run on z/OS to set the character set associated with each file in a CICS bundle based on the file extension. The character set is used by some file editors to automatically convert files to and from non-native EBCDIC code pages to browse and edit files. This can make it easier to quickly view CICS bundles when diagnosing issues.
Requirements

bash is used to run the script. For Linux this is likely pre-installed. For z/OS it is available from Ported Tools.
chtag is used to set the character set associated with the file as part of the the file tags. This is installed as part of z/OS.
