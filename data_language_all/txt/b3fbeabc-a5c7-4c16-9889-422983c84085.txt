Anything Bucket
AnythingBucket is an CouchDB based iPhone "Anything Bucket" app.
I'm using it as more of a tool to help me flesh out Trundle

How to build
Make sure you've got all the submodules first:
git submodule update --init --recursive

You will need a filed called "BUMP_API_KEY" at the root level of the AnythingBucket directory. This file should contain an API key from http://bu.mp/api - but an empty file will allow the project to compile.
