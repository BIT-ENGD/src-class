Wiremaps
Wiremaps is an application to gather wiring (aka L2) information on a
network using protocols like LLDP, EDP, CDP and SONMP. It also gathers
information from the FDB (MAC-port table on switches), the ARP table
(MAC-IP table) and some miscellaneous information like interface
names.
Warning: Wiremaps is not well-maintained. It is aging and may be
unlikely to produce good results out-of-the box. I intend to rewrite
it at some point but didn't get time yet.
The ARP table is only used to link IP addresses to MAC addresses (and
vice-versa). We don't use the information about the interface where
this information came from.
GNU/Linux workstations need an LLDP daemon using SNMP to export
information gathered. Otherwise, almost no information can be
extracted from those hosts.
The situation is the same for Windows. However, there exists a
commercial one.
Installation
To use this application, you need the following Debian packages:
 - postgresql-8.2 (PostgreSQL 8.2)
 - python-psycopg2 (Psycopg)
   (or alternatively, python-pgsql (PyPgSQL Python bindings))
 - python-twisted-core (Twisted)
 - python-twisted-names (Twisted Names)
 - python-nevow (Nevow)
 - python-ipy (iPy)
 - python-yaml (PyYAML)
 - python-dev
 - libsnmp-dev
You then need to create a database and install the corresponding
schema. As postgres user (su - postgres), you can use the following:
createuser -P wiremaps
createdb -O wiremaps wiremaps

You need to write a wiremaps.cfg file. See doc/wiremaps.cfg.sample
for an example. The default path for this file is
/etc/wiremaps/wiremaps.cfg. You can alter it with --config option.
You can install the application with:
python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install

Errors about missing twisted/plugins/__init__.py can be ignored. You
need to have the appropriate libraries and development tools to be
able to compile Python modules. On Debian/Ubuntu, this is python-dev
package. You also need Net-SNMP and its development files. On
Debian/Ubuntu, this is libsnmp-dev package.
If you do not wish to install the application, you still need to
compile the module to build SNMP queries. This can be done with:
python setup.py build_ext --inplace

You can launch the application by hand
twistd -no wiremaps

or
twistd -no wiremaps --config=/etc/wiremaps/wiremaps.cfg

By default, wiremaps only listens on localhost. You can change this using:
twistd -no wiremaps --interface=0.0.0.0

You can also use debian/init.d as a base for an init script (work
only if the application is installed). The init.d script also allows
to use older version of Twisted (2.4).
Indexation is not done automatically. You must browse
http://localhost:8087/api/1.0/equipment/refresh to initiate a whole
refresh. Put this command in a crontab:
16 */3 * * * nobody curl -s http://localhost:8087/api/1.0/equipment/refresh

In the git repository (git clone git://github.com/vincentbernat/wiremaps.git),
there is a debian/ directory that builds a Debian package (with
dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc). It does not setup the database.
