yaml-to-struct
An example of data parsing to C struct from YAML file.
Scope
This code is a small example for parsing data, from a YAML format configuration file, to a C data structure, using libyaml.
Use
For test case we use a configuration file which describes a 2D thin-wire coil. The coil is made from circular loops, each with 3 attributes (radius, x and y position). Also there are 2 global attributes for the coil (current and frequency). The executable nees one argument which denotes the number of the circular loops (yaml mappings) which we want to parse in from the configuration file. After succesfull parsing the parsed data from the structure are printed in the stdout.
Reallocation
Since the number of the mappings inside the sequence of the config.yaml file are not previously known, the data structure is dynamicaly allocated using the user's defined argument of the mappings which are going to be parsed. If the number of mappings (loops) requested by the user are different from that in the configuration file then:


If the are more mappings in the config.yaml the parsing stops, a warning message is printed in the stdout. 


If there are less mappings the parsing stops and the dynamic memory allocated arrays are reallocated to the lenght of the existing and parsed mappings. Also a warning message is printed in the stdout.


In the two previous cases the parsing is considered succesfull.
