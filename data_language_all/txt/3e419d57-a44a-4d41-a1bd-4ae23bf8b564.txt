USING CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR
I created this repository to experiment with the
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR to link with different libraries based on the
architecture. Somehow the CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR that I define in my
toolchain files is overwritten. Using a cached variable doesn't seem
to make a difference.
Reproduce the issue
git clone git@github.com:roxlu/cmake_multi_arch.git
cd cmake_multi_arch
cd build
./release.sh
