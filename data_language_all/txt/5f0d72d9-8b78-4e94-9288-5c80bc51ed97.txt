Measures
@meta
CurrentModule = CasaCore.Measures
Load this module by running
julia
using CasaCore.Measures
The Measures module is used to interface with the CasaCore measures system, which can be used to
perform coordinate system conversions. For example, UTC time can be converted to atomic time, or a
B1950 coordinates can be converted to J2000 coordinates.
At the moment there are 3 different kinds of measures available:

Epochs - representing an instance in time
Directions - representing a direction to an object on the sky
Positions - representing a location on the Earth

Units
CasaCore.Measures depends on the Unitful package in
order to specify the units associated with various quantities. The Unitful package should have
automatically been installed when you ran Pkg.add("CasaCore"). You can load the Unitful package by
running using Unitful and documentation for Unitful is also
available. Unitful is a particularly elegant package for
unit-checked computation because the unit checking occurs at compile-time. That is, there is no
run-time overhead associated with using Unitful.
Unitful offers two ways to attach units to a quantity:
julia
using Unitful: m
x = 10.0 * u"m" # using the u"..." string macro
y = 10.0 * m    # using the Unitful.m object (which we have imported into our namespace)
The first approach using the string macro is generally preferred because it avoids polluting the
namespace. Simply replace the ... in u"..." with your desired units. For example we could obtain
units of meters per second by writing u"m/s" or radians per kilometer-squared by writing
u"rad/km^2".
CasaCore.Measures, however, will only expect quantities with three different kinds of units: times,
lengths, and angles. These are summarized below.
|    Unit    | Expression |
|:----------:|:----------:|
|   Seconds  |   u"s"   |
|    Days    |   u"d"   |
|   Meters   |   u"m"   |
| Kilometers |   u"km"  |
|   Degrees  |   u"°"   |
|   Radians  |  u"rad"  |
!!! note
    The ° character for degrees con be obtained at the Julia REPL by typing \degree and then
    pressing <tab>. The Julia plugins for Emacs and vim also provide this functionality.
UnitfulAstro extends base Unitful with additional
units commonly encountered in astronomy (for instance, pc and Jy).
Epochs
An epoch measure is created using the Epoch(sys, time) constructor where sys specifies the
coordinate system and time specifies the Julian date.
