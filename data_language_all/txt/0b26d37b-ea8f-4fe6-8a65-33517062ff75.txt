Google Calendar Web Material

Description
This project is dedicated to give the https://calendar.google.com/ site a Material Design look. This is my first project from scratch (please treat it accordingly), which I am very excited about. I hope you will enjoy it! If you have any questions, or you would like to contribute, contact me: info@balazsorban.com
Functionality
Dynamic background

The background changes each month to correspond Google's images extracted right from the Google Calendar Android app.

Event flairs

On mobile devices, if an event's title contains a special word, the calendar will treat it special, and will give it an image to make it stand out better. Here is a list of usable words (WIP).
NOTE: I already added some extra, and I am planning to expand the default list with even more event flairs.
 Example of an event flair on mobile:

     Event containing the word "drink".
