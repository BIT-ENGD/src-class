Hammer Buildpack for Heroku
This buildpack allows you to deploy a Hammer project to Heroku as a static site, served with Nginx.
Repositories are considered a valid Hammer project if they contain a Build directory. This directory must be committed to the repository because the Hammer build process cannot be run on the server, only locally.
Usage
$ heroku create --stack cedar --buildpack http://github.com/danpalmer/heroku-buildpack-hammer.git

$ git push heroku master
