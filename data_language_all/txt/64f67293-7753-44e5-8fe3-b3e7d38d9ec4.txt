Why should you care?
Let's be clear here, HTTP Basic Auth isn't the most secure thing in the world, but many times it's all you really need. Whether you're staging a site for a private audience or hiding a couple trade secrets adding a username and password to your static site should be easy. Simply provide publicist a username:password string and we'll do the heavy lifting.
Aside from being simple, publicist is also powerful. We allow you to lockdown multiple routes with different usernames and passwords through powerful globstar matching.
