 ‚õîÔ∏è AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END 
Overview of tools

:ballot_box_with_check: I recommend we try Poi.


Poi is a configuration-free CLI that automatically enables builds optimized and minified apps with:
Transpilation and bundling (with webpack and babel/postcss)
Hot code reloading
Files in ./static are copied to dist folder, eg. static/favicon.ico to dist/favicon.ico
Vue JSX component support by default with babel-preset-vue-app
Code-splitting
Polyfills (if required)
Webpack support
Custom HTML output with the html-webpack-plugin
Results for js web frameworks benchmark - round 6. Use this to compare Vue and React.
