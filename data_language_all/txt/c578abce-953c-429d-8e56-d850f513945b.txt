How to Install Open vSwitch on Red Hat Enterprise Linux
This document describes how to build and install Open vSwitch on a Red
Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) host.  If you want to install Open vSwitch
on a generic Linux host, see INSTALL.md instead.
We have tested these instructions with RHEL 5.6 and RHEL 6.0.
For RHEL 7.x (or derivatives, such as CentOS 7.x), you should follow
the instructions in [INSTALL.Fedora.md].  The Fedora spec files are
used for RHEL 7.x.
Building Open vSwitch for RHEL
You may build from an Open vSwitch distribution tarball or from an
Open vSwitch Git tree.
The default RPM build directory (_topdir) has five directories in
the top-level:
1. BUILD/ Where the software is unpacked and built.
2. RPMS/ Where the newly created binary package files are written.
3. SOURCES/ Contains the original sources, patches, and icon files.
4. SPECS/ Contains the spec files for each package to be built.
5. SRPMS/ Where the newly created source package files are written.
Before you begin, note the RPM sources directory on your version of
RHEL.  The command "rpmbuild --showrc" will show the configuration
for each of those directories. Alternatively, the command "rpm --eval
 '%{_topdir}'" shows the current configuration for the top level
directory and the command "rpm --eval '%{_sourcedir}'" does the same
for the sources directory. On RHEL 5, the default RPM _topdir is
/usr/src/redhat and the default RPM sources directory is
/usr/src/redhat/SOURCES. On RHEL 6, the default _topdir is
$HOME/rpmbuild and the default RPM sources directory is
$HOME/rpmbuild/SOURCES.

Install build prerequisites:

yum install gcc make python-devel openssl-devel kernel-devel graphviz \
       kernel-debug-devel autoconf automake rpm-build redhat-rpm-config \
       libtool


If you are building from a distribution tarball, skip to step 3.
   Otherwise, you must be building from an Open vSwitch Git tree.
   Determine what version of Autoconf is installed (e.g. run "autoconf
   --version").  If it is not at least version 2.63, then you have two
   choices:
a. Install Autoconf 2.63 or later, one way or another.
b. Create a distribution tarball on some other machine, by
    running "./boot.sh; ./configure; make dist" in the Git tree.
    You must run this on a machine that has the tools listed in
    INSTALL.md as prerequisites for building from a Git tree.
    Afterward, proceed with the rest of the instructions using
    the distribution tarball.


Some versions of the RHEL 6 kernel-devel package contain a broken
   "build" symlink.  If you are using such a version, you must fix
   the problem before continuing.


To find out whether you are affected, run:
   
rpmbuild -bb \
    -D "kversion 2.6.32-131.6.1.el6.x86_64" \
    -D "kflavors default debug kdump" \
    rhel/openvswitch-kmod-rhel6.spec
```

This produces an "kmod-openvswitch" RPM for each kernel variant, in
   this example: "kmod-openvswitch", "kmod-openvswitch-debug", and
   "kmod-openvswitch-kdump".
A RHEL host has default firewall rules that prevent any Open vSwitch tunnel
traffic from passing through. If a user configures Open vSwitch tunnels like
Geneve, GRE, VXLAN, LISP etc., they will either have to manually add iptables
firewall rules to allow the tunnel traffic or add it through a startup script
(Please refer to the "enable-protocol" command in the ovs-ctl(8) manpage).
Red Hat Network Scripts Integration
Simple integration with Red Hat network scripts has been implemented.
Please read rhel/README.RHEL in the source tree or
/usr/share/doc/openvswitch/README.RHEL in the installed openvswitch
package for details.
