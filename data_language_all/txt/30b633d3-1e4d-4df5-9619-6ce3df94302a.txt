Contributing to Numenta Apps
Thank you for your interest in helping us improve and evolve the Numenta applications.
Before your pull requests will be reviewed by our team of committers, you'll need to sign our Contributor License. You can see the current list of contributors who've signed our CL. Please also review our coding standards before opening a PR.
At this time, we're only allowing Numenta employees and contractors to be committers since we have a relatively firm idea of which direction we want to head with these applications.  In time, we expect to expand access to a broader community.  In the meantime, we hope that the applications and source code will be useful to those in the NuPIC community who are interested in developing their own applications.
