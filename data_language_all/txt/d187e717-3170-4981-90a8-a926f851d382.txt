Graph API Webhooks Hubot Sample
This example is a Hubot script that messages a chat room when a Facebook Page post is published using Facebook's Graph API Webhooks.  The message includes a link to the Facebook post.  The bot will post another message with the number of likes on the post after a configurable number of minutes.
These instructions assume you have already set up Hubot on Heroku or Hubot on another platform.
Setup

Download graph-api-webhooks.coffee.
Add a line to hubot-scripts.json with graph-api-webhooks.

Using token as the verify_token, set up your Facebook application's Graph API Webhooks subscription using https://<your-subdomain>.herokuapp.com/facebook as the callback URL, and/or your Instagram client's subscription using your https://<your-subdomain>.herokuapp.com/instagram as the callback URL.
Set the Heroku configuration values defined at the top of graph-api-webhooks.coffee before deploying.
FACEBOOK_APP_ACCESS_TOKEN - access token for your Facebook app
