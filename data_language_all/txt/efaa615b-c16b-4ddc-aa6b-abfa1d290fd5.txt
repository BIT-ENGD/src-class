Build System Playground
This is a playground to try out different build systems.

Notes
These might be good to put into a Makefile or something else in order for other people to know how to use this build system.
To build
If ./build doesn't exist than 'meson build' will need to be ran
Once ./build exists than you will need to to do the following 'ninja-build -C build'
To run tests
You can run the test by using  'ninja-build -C build test'.
You can run the Google test executable yourself while in the ./build directory
You can run mesontest from the root directory.
The ninja-build and mesontest option will log the output the results from the test to a file in ./build/seson-logs/testlog.[txt json]
