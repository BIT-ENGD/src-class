SPARCAS
SPARCAS is a traffic simulation library that can be used by writing scala scripts as a command line based traffic simulation software
What is implemented
At the moment only equilibrium traffic assignment is implemented. More is to come.
SPARCAS is a higher level front-end to "BCFW".
Building
SPARCAS can be build by running 'sbt assembly' . It is tested on scala 2.11 running on OpenJDK.
After that youn can write your own scripts and run them.
How to use
An example of building a simple network, a matrix, running an assignment and getting the results is    FourPaths .
Even if you do not know scala, it still possible to use this library by mimicking this file.
