Unmaintained
I never used this package myself and no longer want to maintain it.
I might still fix bugs but all feature requests will be closed.
Contact me if you are interested in becoming the new maintainer.
git svn extension for Magit
This package provides basic support for git svn, a Git command
that aims to provide bidirectional operation between a Subversion
repository and Git.  See its manual page git-svn(1) for more
information.
When magit-svn-mode is turned on then the unpushed and unpulled
commit relative to the Subversion repository are displayed in the
status buffer, and N is bound to a popup with commands that wrap
the git svn subcommands fetch, rebase, dcommit, branch
and tag, as well as a few extras.
To enable the mode in a particular repository use:
cd /path/to/repository
git config --add magit.extension svn

To enable the mode for all repositories use:
git config --global --add magit.extension svn

To enable the mode globally without dropping to a shell:
(add-hook 'magit-mode-hook 'magit-svn-mode)

If you are looking for native SVN support in Emacs, then have a
look at psvn.el and info node (emacs)Version Control.
