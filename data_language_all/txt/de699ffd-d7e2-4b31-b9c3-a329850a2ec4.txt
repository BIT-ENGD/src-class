
Playlyfe Node SDK 
Playlyfe API implementation in NodeJS. This module integrates seamlessly with the passport-playlyfe module for authentication support.

To learn more about how you can build applications on Playlyfe visit the official developer documentation
Install
To get started simply run
sh
npm install playlyfe
The Playlyfe class allows you to make rest api calls like GET, POST, .. etc

Usage
Create a client
If you haven't created a client for your game yet just head over to Playlyfe and login into your account, and go to the game settings and click on client.
1. Client Credentials Flow
In the client page select Yes for both the first and second questions

js
var Playlyfe = require('playlyfe').Playlyfe;
var PlaylyfeException = require('playlyfe').PlaylyfeException;
var pl = new Playlyfe({
    type: 'client'
    version: 'v1',
    client_id: "Your client id",
    client_secret: "Your client secret"
});
You just need to create a new Playlyfe Client and then make calls using it.
2. Authorization Code Flow
In the client page select yes for the first question and no for the second

js
var Playlyfe = require('playlyfe').Playlyfe;
var PlaylyfeException = require('playlyfe').PlaylyfeException;
var pl = new Playlyfe({
    type: 'code'
    version: 'v1',
    client_id: "Your client id",
    client_secret: "Your client secret",
    redirect_uri: 'https://playlyfe.com/redirect'
});
In this Flow you need to pass in the authorization code to the sdk by calling 
js 
exchangeCode(code)
atleast once. After this you can make any requests as the user has to be authenticated first.
3. Custom Login Flow using JWT(JSON Web Token)
In the client page select no for the first question and yes for the second

js
var token = Playlyfe.createJWT({
    client_id: 'your client_id', 
    client_secret: 'your client_secret', 
    player_id: 'johny', // The player id associated with your user
    scopes: ['player.runtime.read', 'player.runtime.write'], // The scopes the player has access to
    expires: 3600; // 1 hour
})
This is used to create jwt token which can be created when your user is authenticated. This token can then be sent to the frontend and or stored in your session. With this token the user can directly send requests to the Playlyfe API as the player.
Client Scopes

Your client has certain access control restrictions. There are 3 kind of resources in the Playlyfe REST API they are
1./admin -> routes for you to perform admin actions like making a player join a team
2./design -> routes for you to make design changes programmatically
3./runtime -> routes which the users will generally use like getting a player profile, playing an action
The resources accessible to this client can be configured to have a read permission that means only GET requests will work.
The resources accessible to this client can be configured to have a write permission that means only POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE requests will work.
The version restriction is only for the design resource and can be used to restrict the client from accessing any version of the game design other than the one specified. By default it allows all.
If access to a route is not allowed and then you make a request to that route then you will get an error like this,
json
{
  "error": "access_denied",
  "error_description": "You are not allowed to access this api route"
}
Documentation
You can initiate a client by giving the client_id and client_secret params
js
var Playlyfe = require('playlyfe').Playlyfe;
var PlaylyfeException = require('playlyfe').PlaylyfeException;
var pl = new Playlyfe({
    type: 'client' or 'code',
    client_id: 'Your client id',
    client_secret: 'Your client Secret',
    version: 'v1',
    redirect_uri: 'The url to redirect to', //only for auth code flow
    store: function(access_token, done) {
        //This function which will persist the access token to a database.
        //You  have to persist the token to a database if you want the access
        //token to remain the same in every request
        done(null, access_token);
    }, 
    load: function(done) {
        //This function which will load the access token. This is called 
        //internally by the sdk on every request so the the access token can 
        //be  persisted between requests
       done(null, access_token);
    }
});
In development the sdk caches the access token in memory so you dont need to provide the store and load functions. But in production it is highly recommended to persist the token to a database. It is very simple and easy to do it with redis. You can see the test cases for more examples.

Methods
All these methods return a bluebird Promise.
All these methods return the request data only when full_response is false
but return headers, status, body of the response when full_response is true.
api (method, route, query, body, full_response = false)
This will allow you to make any HTTP method request to the Playlyfe API
get (route, query, full_response = false)
This will make a GET request to the Playlyfe API
post (route, query, body, full_response = false)
This will make a POST request to the Playlyfe API
patch (route, query, body, full_response = false)
This will make a PATCH request to the Playlyfe API
put (route, query, body, full_response = false)
This will make a PUT request to the Playlyfe API
delete (route, query, full_response = false)
This will make a DELETE request to the Playlyfe API
upload (url, query, formData, full_response)
This will upload any formData you want to send to the server like files, images etc.
Files need to be sent as streams like this,
upload("/runtime/player/image", req.query, {file: fs.createReadStream(path) })
This uses the request library so the pattern should be the same
getAuthorizationURI ()
This will return the url to which the user needs to be redirected to login.
This doesn't need
exchangeCode (code)
This is used in the auth code flow so that the sdk can get the access token.
Before any request to the playlyfe api is made this has to be called atleast once.This should be called in the the route/controller which you specified in your redirect_uri.
PlaylyfeException
This is thrown whenever an error occurs in each call. The Error contains the name, message, status, headers and data fields which can be used to determine the type of error that occurred.
