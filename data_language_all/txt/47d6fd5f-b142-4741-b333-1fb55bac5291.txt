PLIHBMTTBHGATY COBOL
Some COBOL written for PLIBMTTBHGATY v2.0 in London.
See Denise's writeup for a much
more thorough
explanation of what we learned that day.
Compiling
Fire up a useful Docker container:
docker run -it -v $PWD:/root/cobol -w /root/docker gregcoleman/docker-cobol /bin/bash
This volume maps wherever you've cloned this to /root/cobol within the
running Docker container.
In the container, head to the right directory:
cd /root/cobol
Compile:
cobc -x tictactoe.cob -o tictactoe
Run:
./tictactoe
Let's party like it's 1959
