Matfacgrf
Matrix Factorization for Graph Analysis

The directory src contains some Matlab and Julia code to perform the factorization and
any experiments that needs to be done for the paper.
The test directory contains some test and demonstration code.
You should look there for code that illustrates how to call other code.
We will put any large dependencies into a folder called deps.
