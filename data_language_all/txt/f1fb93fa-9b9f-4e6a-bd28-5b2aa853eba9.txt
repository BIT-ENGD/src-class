The NPN on the 12V are important(1500mA, 40V) but he PNP on the 3v can be swapped for what you have, I have used BC320 amongst others.
I have had this type of circuit talking to a VT101 DECTerminal.


Reset GPIO_16 needs to be “PULLED_UP” at all times the only way for the pin to be low is when 0 is Written as an output, the circuit above has a “leakage path” to ground which is unsuitable for the reset pin GPIO_16.
The circuit below shows GPIO_16 with an additional inverter transistor as an output.
This can be used on any pin, with the inverter The RED channel stays on until the CODE starts,
The GREEN and BLUE come on then fade.


The Circuit below is the same as above but no inverter stage, Invert the code  for GPIO Pin - “PWM Write (PWM Resolution - PWM write value)”. No RED component active until Code starts.
Additional parts are required for Relays.
