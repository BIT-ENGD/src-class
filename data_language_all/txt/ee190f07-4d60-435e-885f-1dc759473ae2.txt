Pattern matching as an exercise. This really shouldn't be used right
now. Probably slow as hell. Instead, you should check out the similarly

Three macros are exposed: @match, @matching, and @matchcase.
@match is the primary pattern-matching switch statement. @matching
is a helper for creating functions the body of which are solely @match
expressions. @matchcase is a helper for autogenerating the boilerplate
necessary to pattern match using constructor-like syntax.
The examples serve as a syntax reference.
