What is Computer Network?

Computer Network means, a collection of Computers, and other devices, or peripherals connected together through connecting media


Peripheral Device

A computer device, such as CD-ROM drive or printer, that is not part of the essential computer, i.e., the memory and microprocessor. 
Peripheral devices can be external – such as mouse, keyboard, printer, monitor, external Zip drive or scanner.
Peripheral devices can be internal, such as CD-ROM drive, or internal modem.
Internal peripheral devices are often refered to as integrated peripherals.

Benefits of Computer Networks
Resources Sharing
- File Sharing 
- Peripheral Sharing 
- Software Sharing with multi-user licenses
Basic Network Elements
Hardware
- Computers / Peripherals
- NICs
- Connecting Media
- Networking Device(s)
  - Routers
  - Switches
  - Bridges 
  - Hubs 
- Software
- Protocols
  - Communication rules that all entity must agree on
Network Devices

NIC (Network Interface Card)
The hardware that plugs into the motherboard and directly access the network
Hub
Allow different nodes to communicate with each other
Switch
Allow different nodes to communicate with each other
at the same time without slowing each other down.   
Router

Allow different networks to communicate with each other 


NETGEAR NIC-FA312




Cisco SG300-28 28-Port Gigabit Managed Switch

Series: Cisco Small Business 300 Series Managed Switches



Cisco 2801 Integrated Services Router
Series: Cisco 2800 Series Integrated Services Routers


Classifications of Networks

According to Covered Area
According to Network Model
According to Network Topology

Area Networks

Local Area Networks
A LAN is a group of computers connected in small geographical area
Allow users to share files and services
Wide Area Networks
A WAN is a group of computers connected in Large geographical area such as country 
A WAN often connects two LANs (WAN Link)
Metropolitan Area Networks 
A MAN connects an area larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, such as a city

Network Models
Two basic types of networks
- Peer-to-Peer Networks
- Client/Server Networks
Peer-to-Peer Networks

In a peer-to-peer network, all computers are considered equal; they all have the same abilities to use the resources available on the network. 
Example : Windows Workgroup


Client / Server Networks

Some nodes (SERVER) are dedicated to present services to other nodes (CLIENTS)
Examples: 
Mail Server
Web Server


Network Topologies

Topology refers to the shape of a network, or the network's layout.
How different nodes in a network are connected to each other and how they communicate are determined by the network's topology. 
The choice of topology is dependent upon 
Type and number of equipment being used 
Cost 

Network Topologies
Computer networks topologies
- Bus
- Star
- Ring
- Mesh
- Hybrid
Bus Topology
All devices are connected to a central cable, called the bus or backbone

Bus Topology

Both ends of the network must be terminated with a terminator

A barrel connector can be used to extend the network



The backbone functions as a shared communication medium 

Device wanting to communicate with another device on the network sends a message onto the backbone
The message is heard by all stations, but only the intended recipient actually accepts and processes the message. 
Terminator absorbs frames at end of medium

Frame Transimission - Bus LAN

Station C want to transmit a frame of data to station A.


Bus Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages
Simple, easy to use and construct

Requires least amount of cable (less expensive)


Disadvantages

A faulty cable will take the entire LAN down 
Difficult to troubleshoot
Heavy network traffic can slow bus considerably

Star Topology

A physical Star topology connects the devices via a centralized unit such as a Hub or Switch
Nodes communicate across the network by passing data through the central device


Star Types

Broadcasted Star Topology (Hubbed Star)
Switched Star Topology (Switched Star)


Star Advantages

Single computer failure doesn’t bring down whole network
Adding new devices to a Star network is very simple compared to any of the other topologies
No disruptions to the network when connecting or removing devices. 
Centralized control 
Centralized network/hub monitoring 
Easy to troubleshoot

Star Disadvantages

If central device fails, the whole network fails
Compared to the bus topology, a star network generally requires more cable
More expensive than linear bus topologies because of the cost of the central device 

Hubbed Star Rule

Hubs simply pass on all the information they receive
This limits the number of hubs you can connect together
The maximum number of allowed repeater hops is four

Ring Topology

All devices are connected to one another in the shape of a closed loop, so that each device is connected directly to two other devices, one on either side of it
Data is passed one way from device to device


Ring Topology

A short message (called a token) is circulated around the ring, being passed from station to station.
The token originates from a controller or master station which inserts it onto the ring. 
A station which wants to transmit waits for the token to arrive. 
When the token arrives, the station changes it from a token to a connector message, and appends its message. This new message is then placed on the outgoing side of the ring. 
Each station passes on received tokens if they have nothing to transmit. 
They monitor connector messages to see if the message is addressed to them. 
If connector messages are addressed to them, they copy the message, modify it to signify its receipt, then send it on around the ring. 
Connector messages which are not addressed to them are passed directly on to the next station in the ring. 
When the connector message travels full circle and arrives at the original sending station, it checks the message to see if it's been received. It then discards the message and replaces it with a token. 

Ring Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages 

Perform well under heavy traffic


Disadvantages

If one device/cable fails then the whole network goes down. 
Difficult to troubleshoot
Adding/Removing computers disrupts the whole network

Mesh Topology

In a mesh topology each device/PC is connected to every other device/PC in the network by its own cable 


Mesh Types

FUll Mesh
Partial Mesh

Mesh Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages

Mesh topology boasts the highest fault tolerance of all of the network topologies 


Disadvantages

Because each connection needs its own cable a Mesh topology can get very expensive

Hybrid Topologies


Hybrid means that there is more than one topology exist


Stared Bus

Groups of star-configured networks are connected to a linear bus backbone 
  

Hybrid Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages

Network expansion is simple


Disadvantages

If hub fails connections between failed hub and other hubs will fail
