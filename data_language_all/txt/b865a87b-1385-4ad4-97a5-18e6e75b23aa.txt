We wish to plot the sine
function from 0-360 and take snap shots every 20. To get a smooth curve
we must sample the function much more frequently; we settle on 10 times
more frequently than the frame spacing. We place a bright red circle at
the leading edge of the curve, and as we move forward in time (here,
angles) we dim the older circles to a dark red color. We add a label
that indicates the current angle value. Once the 18 frames are completed
we convert them to a single animated GIF file.
