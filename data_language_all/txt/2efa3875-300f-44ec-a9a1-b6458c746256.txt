SR(A)WN 2016 — 9
This is the ninth issue of the 2016 Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter, a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings‐on across Student Robotics. Emboldened items are ones which we believe could do with extra hands. An absence of emboldening does not necessarily mean that everything is done.


Student Robotics has been successfully registered as a charity.
There is a possibility of some media opportunities happening with the BBC in the near future and any related media items are being collated.


Thanks to everyone who helped put this issue together. If you would like, you can also read the previous issue.
