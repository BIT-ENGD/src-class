Unreleased
2.2.0 - 2021-06-28
Changed

Disabled crafting recipes for coins by default.
They can be enabled again by setting maptools.enable_coin_crafting = true
    in minetest.conf.
Map Tools nodes can no longer be exploded by TNT.
Switched from Travis CI to GitHub Actions for continuous integration.

2.1.0 - 2020-06-08
Changed

10 coins of each type can now be crafted using 2 ingots (bronze, silver or gold).
Silver coins require More Ores
    to be crafted, since minetest_game doesn't have silver ingots.
Coins are now displayed in the creative inventory.
Moved translations from intllib to Minetest's built-in localization system.
This allows translations to show up independently of the server's language.

2.0.0 - 2019-11-25
Changed

The minimum supported Minetest version is now 5.0.0.
Map Tools nodes/items can no longer be dropped to prevent them from falling
  into bad hands.

Fixed

The inventory images of no_interact, no_build, ignore_like_no_clip
  and ignore_like_no_point now use textures that are available in
  Minetest Game 5.0.0.

1.1.0 - 2019-03-23
Changed

Increased the range of the Admin Pickaxe from 12 to 20 nodes.
Updated intllib support to avoid using deprecated functions.

1.0.0 - 2017-02-19

Initial versioned release.
