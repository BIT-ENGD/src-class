FunctionWrappers.jl: Type stable and efficient wrapper of arbitrary functions



Proof of principle implementation of JuliaLang/julia#13984.
Limitations


Does not handle more than 128 arguments without jlcall wrapper
128 is an arbitrary limit. Should be high enough for all practical cases


Does not support vararg argument types


Wrapper Object cannot be serialized by dump.c and therefore the
   precompilation of FunctionWrappers is done using a runtime branch
   and by making the wrapper type mutable.
