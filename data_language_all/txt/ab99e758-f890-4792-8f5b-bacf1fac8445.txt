ubirch wolfSSL package build
This is a CMake package for the wolfSSL library. It
creates a wolfSSL library target as well that can be found by other CMake projects using find_package().
It requires the Kinetis SDK package to be
build beforehand.
Building

Checkout the ubirch-arm-toolchain
Create a build directory:
  mkdir build
  cd build
Run cmake (providing the toolchain, and if necessary the wolfSSL dir: -DWOLFSSL_ROOT=<wolfssl-dir>):
  cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<toolchain-dir>/cmake/ubirch-arm-toolchain.cmake
Run make
  make


If you want to build all different configuration types (Debug, Release, MinSizeRel, ...)
you need to create a build directory for every configuration and run cmake with an extra
argument -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<build-type> as well as make.

Contents

CMakeLists.txt - package build file
build.sh - default build file, creating a sub directory build and runs cmake and make
