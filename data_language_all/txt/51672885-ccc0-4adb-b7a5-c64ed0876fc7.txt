SBT Basics
This file contains the sbt exercises. For each exercise, you have to create a simple sbt project in this directory. You only have to submit the final state of the project; the intermediate steps that some of the exercises have are still important for your understanding, but don't need to be submitted.


Create an SBT project in a directory 1-hello-world, with code in src/main/scala. When running this project with sbt run, it should print Hello world!


Create an SBT project in a directory 2-dependencies, make it use scala version 2.11.7. Add a dependency on Joda Time, and open a console. Create a Joda DateTime in the console. Add a test-dependency on Scalatest, write a test for Joda Datetime that fails. Keep tests running with a tilde task. Change the test until it passes.


Create an SBT project in a directory 3-errors, add a source file with at least 5 errors. Change a setting interactively to make SBT only show you 3 errors. Then save the setting (this is not what you'd normally do, but required to review the solution ;)).


Create an SBT project in a directory 4-updates, and add an older version of Joda Time as a dependency. Setup the sbt-updates plugin in the project and get it to tell you that you should update Joda time.
