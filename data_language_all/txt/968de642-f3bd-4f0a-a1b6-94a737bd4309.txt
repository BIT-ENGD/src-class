Arrow Function

Arrow functions were introduced in ES6.
Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax:

js
hello = () => {
  return "Hello World!";
}

If the function has only one statement, and the statement returns a value, you can remove the brackets and the return keyword:

js
hello = () => "Hello World!";

Arrow Function have only 1 Parameters:


'this' in Arrow Function

this is also different in arrow functions compared to regular functions.

In short, with arrow functions there are no binding of this.


In regular functions : this keyword represented the object that called the function

In arrow functions the : this keyword always represents the object that defined the arrow function.

Anonymous Function

An anonymous function is a function that was declared without any named identifier to refer to it. 

As such, an anonymous function is usually not accessible after its initial creation.


Anonymous function definition:


js
var hello = function() {
  alert('I am anonymous');
}
hello();
