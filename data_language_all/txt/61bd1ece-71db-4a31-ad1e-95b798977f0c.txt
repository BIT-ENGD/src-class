RabbitMQ Round-Robin Exchange Plugin

A RabbitMQ Plugin that adds a round-robin exchange type. Messages routed
through a x-round-robin exchange will be distributed evenly across all bound
destinations (queues and/or exchanges).
For example, given 12 messages and the queues Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4:

Q1 will receive messages #1, #5, and #9
Q2 will receive messages #2, #6, and #10
Q3 will receive messages #3, #7, and #11
Q4 will receive messages #4, #8, and #12

Supported RabbitMQ Versions
This plugin requires RabbitMQ 3.7.0 or later.
