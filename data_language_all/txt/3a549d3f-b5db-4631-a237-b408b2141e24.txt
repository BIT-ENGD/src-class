title: Where ESXi belongs - Nested under KVM

I can hear it now, why would you want to do that?  Well for me the motivation was I need to test vSphere (ESXi and vCenter) automation and I don't want to install VMware Workstation to do it.
First up, Nested ESXi
As always dependencies are first.  I am using Fedora 21 so the packages commands will be related.

QEMU Changes
Fortunately we have some very smart people at VMware that are willing to help our crazy cause.
QEMU has changed since this post was originally written and so we must modify the patch.
Below are the modifications required for QEMU 2.3, which is the latest development release - your mileage my vary kinda a thing but I haven't had a problem yet.

With the modified QEMU lets get the source, patch and recompile.
Patch and compile QEMU
{% highlight bash %}
cd /opt
sudo git clone https://github.com/qemu/qemu.git
cd qemu
sudo curl "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jcpowermac/3d9c732be08404302083/raw/ba97ceceefb2ffb085fa8da0f5f5a6142127454e/qemu.patch" | sudo patch -p1
sudo ./configure --enable-kvm --target-list=x86_64-linux-user,x86_64-softmmu
sudo make -j8
sudo wget "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jcpowermac/36bfa62cd60781264b3f/raw/f26aa286d5ab85f17555141e04ab549e10727475/qemu-kvm"
{% endhighlight %}
This will leave our original QEMU install untouched, which is probably a good thing.  Next up we need to define a virtual machine.
Create the ESXi virtual machine
There is an issue with ESXi 5.5 and the e1000 network adapter, so we have no real choice except to use vmxnet3.
Below is an example domain specifically for 5.5 because of the inclusion of vmxnet3 adapter.
ESXi 6.0 can and should be using e1000.

To define a new guest, do the following.  A cd-rom will need to be added and most likely source bridge will need to be changed but the general hardware will be correct.
Any of those changes can be done in virt-manager.

wget "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jcpowermac/05e2faa322427f28b907/raw/6149bcc2e5420d13afa96d0f58abc91d6dc84058/esxi.xml"
