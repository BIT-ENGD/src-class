node-version-resolver

Give me a semver range and I'll tell you the latest node version that
satisfies it.

node-version-resolver is a node module that can be use programatically or from
the command line. It downloads a list of all Node.js versions from
nodejs.org/dist and exposes a simple API for
selecting the latest stable (and unstable) versions, as well as matching the
version list against a semver
range.
node-version-resolver's functionality is also available as an HTTP webservice
at semver.io.
Note: 0.8.6 is the oldest available version of node returned by this library.
This choice was made because nodejs.org does not provide builds of older
versions.
Installation
npm install node-version-resolver --save
Command-Line Usage
Pass a semver range argument
to find what version of Node.js currently satisfies it:

Or omit the argument to get the latest stable version:

Programmatic Usage
See test/indexText.coffee
Caching
node-version-resolver is designed to work even if nodejs.org is down or slow
to respond. If the GET request to nodejs.org/dist/
takes too long to resolve, a local copy of cache/node.html file will be
loaded instead. To update the cached file, run:
npm run updateCache
