Restoring the Interview Database from a backup
The prefered method of building the database is to run the SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) project in Visual Studio and build and deploy it using the included project. This will give you data with dates close to the build date and you can explore how the sample data is generated by looking at the post deployment script. Building and deplying the SSDT project isn't always possible if you have a time constraint or if the project happens to fail to build. For those reasons we have included a backup file that includes the interview database and sample date (the data will be older instead of more current with a fresh build)


Download InterviewDB.bak from the github repository.


Next, using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), login to your LocalDB sql server. Once Logged in, Expand the server and right click on the databases folder then select restore
   


Finally, select device and select the .bak file you downloaded from the repo



If you get an error during this step, go to the Files Tab on the left, and check the box that says "Relocate all files to folder"


You should now be able to see the database and begin querying.
