Dynamic Huffman Coding
Written for the course TÖL403G: Analysis of Algorithms, spring semester 2010, at the University of Iceland, by Hörður Freyr Yngvason
The project includes a straightforward implementation of Huffman coding (src/huffman.cpp), as well as Vitter's algorithm for Dynamic Huffman Coding (src/vitter.cpp). The writeup (in Icelandic) can be found in huffman.[tex,pdf].
The original test data is (unfortunately) not included.
