module enhancements
Modules now support filtering and sorting. Sorting can be automatic if you just have one table involved in what is displayed, while filtering does not yet support that. The real benefit is that modules now allow you to completely define the queries yourself, allowing for very advanced filtering/sorting for the module.
There are breaking changes for modules in this release.
