Milestone 1

Use k-means clustering to form occupation nodes into clusters. There will be 4 clusters, each being a quartile of the average/median salaries.

Milestone 2

Apply the k-means clustering across all of the datasets. Use persist and cache to increase performance. Compare and contrast with and without partition/cache.

Milestone 3

Use linear regression to predict the salary change of each occupation based on the data set. 
The data set we form up to do the linear regression would be in the following SVM format:
\ 1:\ 
The year will be the years (2007 onwards). 

The avg_sal will be the average annual salary for each occupation. 


These regression lines will be formed for each occupation to predict their annual average annual salary for the coming years. 

The year 2016 can be used to compare our results if that data is readily available. The source http://www1.salary.com can be used to compare our results.
