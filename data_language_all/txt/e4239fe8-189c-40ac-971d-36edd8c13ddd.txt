   If you like to study these topics, don't hesitate to join it! 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  IMPORTANT: 
  If you are one of the engineers, developers, someone documenting or a tester, don't forget there's a branch called 'development'. We must use that first before to make a pull request to the master. 
  Create any issue about moving files etc. We in that way can avoid any kind of conflict regarding files or programming.
  Thanks!

** If you wanna know where it's the project now ? in which stage somehow?... Follow this link! 
Technical stuff*:
Development** vs Production (The master branch)
Don't write initially in the master branch, all first goes to development. then we pull request to master which is 'Production'.
If you want to download the whole development files, go to the 'development' branch -> 
https://github.com/Vollj/Theatherflix/tree/development
If you want to clone the development branch follow this:

git clone -b development --single-branch git@github.com:Vollj/Theatherflix.git
cd development (which is downloaded as a folder named 'Theatherflix' though, you rename it)
npm install (We can use Yarn too)
node (or nodemon) server.js 

[*] If you are going to work inside of the project please inform, and them comment everything and please from now on (12-04-2018) add your email, name and date inside of the code you might add, as part of a comment; and keep working always in the development branch first. (Don't forget to use the 'issues' inside of the Github platform as well as please keep checking the progress of the project.).-
The first version where all begun. It's in the Old_branch
If you want to download the old version stored, go to the old branch ->
https://github.com/Vollj/Theatherflix/tree/old_branch
If you want to clone the old branch follow this:

git clone -b old_branch --single-branch git@github.com:Vollj/Theatherflix.git

Installation
To run the Theatherflix web app offline, you need to install the following;

Make sure you have installed Node.js. Versions 6.0.0 and higher should work. We recommend that you use the most-recent "Active LTS" version of Node.js.
Make sure you have installed npm (NB: npm is distributed with Node.js- which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer).   

Check that you have node and npm installed

To check if you have Node.js installed, run this command in your terminal:

node -v

To confirm that you have npm installed you can run this command in your terminal:

npm -v
Quick Start

sudo npm install (You can also use Yarn)
node server.js (recommend install nodemon)
Open http://localhost:3000
