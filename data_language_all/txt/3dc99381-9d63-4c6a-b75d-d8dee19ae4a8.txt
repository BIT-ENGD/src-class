commentary.vim
Comment stuff out.  Use gcc to comment out a line (takes a count),
gc to comment out the target of a motion (for example, gcap to
comment out a paragraph), gc in visual mode to comment out the selection,
and gc in operator pending mode to target a comment.  You can also use
it as a command, either with a range like :7,17Commentary, or as part of a
:global invocation like with :g/TODO/Commentary. That's it.
I wrote this because 5 years after Vim added support for mapping an
operator, I still couldn't find a commenting plugin that leveraged that
feature (I overlooked
tcomment.vim).  Striving for
minimalism, it weighs in at under 100 lines of code.
Oh, and it uncomments, too.  The above maps actually toggle, and gcgc
uncomments a set of adjacent commented lines.
Installation
Install using your favorite package manager, or use Vim's built-in package
support:
mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/tpope/start
cd ~/.vim/pack/tpope/start
git clone https://tpope.io/vim/commentary.git
vim -u NONE -c "helptags commentary/doc" -c q

FAQ

My favorite file type isn't supported!

Relax!  You just have to adjust 'commentstring':
autocmd FileType apache setlocal commentstring=#\ %s
