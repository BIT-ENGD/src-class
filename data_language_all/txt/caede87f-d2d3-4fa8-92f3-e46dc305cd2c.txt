ContinuousTimeMarkov.jl



Overview
A small package for working with continuous-time Markov transition rate matrices.
Currently exposes the following functionality:


wrappers TransitionRateMatrix and TransitionRateMatrix! for creating transition rate matrices (square, nonnegative elements, rows sum to one), and steady_state for calculating steady state distributions.


a CompetingPoisson distribution and random sampler for competing Poisson/exponential events.
