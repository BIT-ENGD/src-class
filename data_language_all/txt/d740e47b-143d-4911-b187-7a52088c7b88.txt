o2r reference implementation on Windows
This document contains Windows-specific configuration and steps.
Please carefully read the sections "Basics" and "Prerequisites" in the file README.md for general information.
In the sections "Build images from source and run" and "Build images from source and run", please be aware of the general remarks but use the docker-compose command from this file instead of the commands using make.
Take a look at the "Troubleshooting" sections in this file if you run into problems.
Windows with Docker for Windows
Docker for Windows is available for 64bit Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise and Education (with Hyper-V available) and on Windows Server 2016 (see Docker Docs).
Simply run the following command to start the services:
shell
docker-compose up
The services are available at http://localhost.
Advanced configuration can be applied by editing the .env file or by specifying the settings as environment variables before executing the docker-compose up command.
Troubleshooting

Make sure that the drive where you cloned this repository to is shared (Docker > Shared Drives), because a configuration file (nginx.conf) must be mounted into the service webserver.
Reconsider using a Linux virtual machine.
Install the latest edge channel of Docker, see https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/faqs/#questions-about-stable-and-edge-channels
Make sure that mounting files into containers works. This thread contains many potentially useful hints and ideas: https://forums.docker.com/t/volume-mounts-in-windows-does-not-work/10693/4
If you want to set environment variables in PowerShell, use this syntax $env:VARIABLENAME = "VARIABLEVALUE"
Inspect your environment variables in PowerShell with Get-ChildItem Env:
If you encounter problems with docker-compose, you might want to install python 2.7, especially when a newer python distribution is installed on your machine

Windows with Docker Toolbox
If your system does not meet the requirements to run Docker for Windows, you can install Docker Toolbox, which uses Oracle Virtual Box instead of Hyper-V, see Docker Docs.
When using Compose with Docker Toolbox/Machine on Windows, volume paths are no longer converted from by default, but we need this conversion to be able to mount the docker volume to the o2r microservices. To re-enable this conversion for docker-compose >= 1.9.0 set the environment variable COMPOSE_CONVERT_WINDOWS_PATHS=1.
Add COMPOSE_CONVERT_WINDOWS_PATHS=1 to the .env file and run:
bash
docker-compose up
The services are available at http://<machine-ip>.
