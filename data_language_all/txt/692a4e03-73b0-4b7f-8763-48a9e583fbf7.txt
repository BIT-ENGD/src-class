Python f√ºr Mathematiker/innen
This is a German "book" outlining some Python basics from the perspective
of a mathematican or a scienctific researcher doing mathematics.
There are three main tracks:

Introduction and basic concepts
Mathemtics, which does cover concrete mathematics up to statistics
Programming techniques goes in depth of various ways how to program

Setup
Tell the %matplotlib inline magic to always use SVG for plotting.
This gives much nicer graphics in the PDF.
For that, in your local ~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py include this:
c = get_config()
c.InlineBackend.figure_format = 'svg'

(If that file isn't there, do not hesitate to create it)
Compile
Just run make or read the [makefile] header to learn more about the targets.
Dependencies
python, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, sympy, networkx, ...
