ua-parser-js doesn't have to be accessed by the window object. Use dependency injection instead. Great for unit test and do everything in the Angular manner.
NOTE: You can use uaParser directly without newing it. It's already initialised for you.
Add ngUaParser as a module dependency to your app after including the ng-ua-parser.js script and inject uaParser anywhere you need.
