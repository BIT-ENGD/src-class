WARNING:  THIS IS NOT COMPLETE  
It is a work in progress.
Blitz Manic Miner running on Love2D - Converter code written by Rob Probin
Ultimately this code will dynamically convert the Blitz Basic version to Lua and use the embedded resources to run the game. (So goes the theory anyway).
I do not claim ownership of Manic Miner, or the Blitz Basic Version by Andy 
Noble [1] - and he's not connected with this effort.
Running This
Steps to get it to run:
1. Download the Blitz Basic source code to the same folder from [2].
2. Unzip it
3. Unzip the nested Source folder.
4. Download Love2D. [3]
5. Run this project.
It will stop with an error because the converter is unfinished.
Debugging This
I use ZeroBrane Studio [7] which allows debugging of Love 2D projects.
Future
It would be nice to run the game on a web page, with Lua converting Blitz Basic. 
That would be silly and impossible, of course [8].
