Android Breakout In Scala
A note on compiling:
After much fighting with different build configs, this is my suggested dev environment for Android and Scala.
- Scala IDE for Eclipse v3.0.0 / For Scala 2.10.X http://scala-ide.org/download/sdk.html
- AndroidProguardScala https://github.com/banshee/AndroidProguardScala
- Download and unpack the Android SDK 
- Import the Android plugin to Scala IDE http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/installing-adt.html
- To add Scala to your Android project -> http://scala-ide.org/docs/tutorials/androiddevelopment/index.html
- Avoid using Android's version of Eclipse that comes bundled with the SDK
