History


v2.2.0 October 7, 2012

@partial signature now changed from @partial(name,data) to @partial(name,objs...)
If multiple objects are specified, they will be shallow-y merged into an empty object
This allows you to do things like @partial('blah',@,{blah:'blah'}) to extend the partial blah with the template data and some custom partial data
