TETRIS - New Version (Using Classes)
As I am starting a series of videos of how to program the TETRIS, I am also starting from scratch. Everything that is applied to the Old Version (details below) is applied to the new.
TETRIS - Old Version
This is a Tetris game programmed with Lua and LÖVE2D 0.8.0 library. 
I programmed it with the intention of teaching others how to program in Lua and LÖVE2D while having fun with it.

Controls
Up Arrow : Change piece position 
Left Arrow : Move piece to the left  
Right Arrow : Move it to the right  
Down Arrow : Currently nothing 
How to use it
The only thing you need is LÖVE2D. Just download the v.0.8.0 and follow the steps.
To execute it, click and drag the root folder of the game to the LÖVE2D.exe icon. If this does not work, check LÖVE2D webpage for other methods.
NOTE: Newer versions might not work properly for this game.
Known Bugs
Sometimes after reaching lvl 4 the chain of pieces may suddenly stop, but the game does not crash.
