Building wheels for biolab/orange3


The Windows, macOS and manylinux wheels are build on appveyor and travis
CI systems.
To make/build a new release, edit the appveyor.yml and .travis.yml files and
change the BUILD_COMMIT version to the appropriate tag/ref in the orange3
git repository. Commit the changes and push the this repo (or create a pull
request and have someone merge it). Once the changes are pushed the builds on
appveyor and travis will be automatically started.
After the wheels are build they are uploaded to
anaconda.org
The windows wheels are also stored as build artifacts on appveyor. For macOS
and manylinux the wheels are also uploaded/shared (for a limited time) using
transfer.sh service. Look for the url in the travis log near the end.
