Chapter 4 - Classes and Objects
Exercise: write an application using the App trait that requires two command-line parameters, named a and b, and calculates and prints the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with a and b the short sides.
Example: running sbt run 30 40 should print 50.
Give a nice error if invalid parameters are passed in.
