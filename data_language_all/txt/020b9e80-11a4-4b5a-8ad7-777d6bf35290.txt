SoftLayer Docker Elastic Search Workshop
This repo serves as a basic tutorial or introduction to Docker containers.
Acknowledgments
The material used within this repo is derived from prior work by Peter Parente and Guillermo Cabrera.
Workshop Preparation
This repo assumes that the Workshop participant has access to a SoftLayer VM with Docker pre-installed. Alternative VM configurations are possible, but the setup of such is beyond the scope of this repo.
Tutorial
The material in this repo can be used in support of a hands-on workshop covering the steps involved in getting Elasticsearch (i.e., a search engine based on Lucene) up and running in a Docker container. 
Using the creation of an Elasticsearch application as a devops goal, the material in this repo will provide a basic introduction to the use of Docker containers for application development. 
The topics to be covered in the workshop include:

Environment setup
Developing containers
Configuring Docker ports and how networking is handled between containers
Distributing containers

The workshop will follow a build, test, explore, repeat pattern, common to the "Dockerization" process.
Slideshow
This repo contains a slide presentation based on reveal.js. Assuming access to a Docker environment, the slides can be viewed by doing the following on your Docker enabled VM:
