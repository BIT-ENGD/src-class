TreeLog-ScalaJS
This project brings together two other projects: the excellent 
TreeLog from Lance and Channing Walton,
and the pretty ReactTreeView component from Chandra Sekhar Kode in the 
scalajs-react-components project.
TreeLog is a way of displaying a program's log in a tree structure instead of the hopelessly
verbose sequential format we are usually cursed with. It is based on the Scalaz Writer monad. 
Although it is oriented towards algorithms with pure functions (like mathematical computations), 
it can annotate tree nodes with messages for side-effects. Read more about it 
at typelevel.
ReactTreeView is the UI part: this component supports expanding nodes, highlighting, and other 
nice features. It existed first as a normal ReactJS component, 
then was adapted into ScalaJS, 
meaning you can write your tree in Scala and it will be 
converted automatically into JavaScript. See the screenshot lower down to see what it looks like. 
Implementation
So, two tree projects: a match made in heaven? All TreeLog-ScalaJS really needs to do
is transform a scalaz.Tree into a UI TreeItem. The main code is in com.oranda.treelogui. 
There is some code here and in demo.components that is copied from the 
scalajs-react-components demo. The code in the treelog package is copied straight from 
the TreeLog project.
Running

Clone this project (or download and unzip).
In the project's root, from the command-line run sbt fastOptJS. This will do all the Scala compilation and
 ScalaJS transpilation.
In your browser navigate to the project's index.html on the filesystem. (There is no need
 to run a server.) You should see:     


Running the tests

Download PhantomJS. This can run JavaScript outside a browser.
Make sure the phantomjs executable is in your PATH environment variable.
In this project's root, from the command-line run sbt test.
