Notes about assets
The .src.svg files are Inkscape source files.
From these files, you Save as... Plain SVG files.
In practice I don't know if it makes a difference considering this is
going through svgo to optimize the files anyway.
LESS CSS inclusion
Read svg.less to see how it works.
The basic idea is that the build process will replace placeholder text
elements with the actual SVG file content. This file content is
massaged lightly via LESS functions.
From then on, you have a LESS Mixin that you can use to refer to the
SVG asset.
