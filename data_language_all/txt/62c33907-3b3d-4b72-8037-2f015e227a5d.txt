Cobweb
Cobweb is a VPN software suite based on a fast and simple custom VPN protocol, designed for building a decentralized federation of self-hosted servers.
Currently Linux and MacOS are supported. Windows support is a long-term goal but not currently planned.
Build & Install
First, install the Rust toolchain if you haven't already. Run the command below and follow the directions presented to you
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
Once you've installed Rust, clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/cobweb-gang/cobweb-server
Move into the repository and compile the code
cd cobweb-server
cargo build --release
Once you've done this, you can run Cobweb as such:
target/release/cobweb-server -p password
You must provide a password via the "-p" flag.
Alternatively, you can move the binary into your $PATH and run it without a directory prefix:
mv target/release/cobweb-server /usr/local/bin/cobweb-server
cobweb-server -p password
Currently, the software is unusable as there is no server currently being hosted. In the beta release, a build option will be added in order to discern between building the client or server version of Cobweb, so the build and installation process is subject to change.
Pre-compiled binaries for Linux and MacOS will be provided with the first beta release.
