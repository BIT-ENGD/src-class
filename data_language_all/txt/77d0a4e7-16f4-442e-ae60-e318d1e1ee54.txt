Slack Resistance
Build: sbt compile stage to build and create start script
Deploy to Heroku: sbt deployHeroku or combined: sbt compile stage deployHeroku 
The Heroku app needs to have the env parameter HOST set to 0.0.0.0 to bind properly.
Defaults to localhost to avoid security warnings when running locally.
You also need to configure the env parameter SLACK_WEBHOOKS to the Slack incoming Webhooks path,
ie https://hooks.slack.com/services/...
