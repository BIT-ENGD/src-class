pokemon-svg
A collection of Pokemon SVGs.  I claim no credit. I have merely assembled
(read: caught) them all in this repo.
Docker
A Dockerfile and Makefile are included so that you can quickly and easily
export images.  Obviously, Docker is required and
and Make is recommended.
The docker image finishes up at about 159.7 MB, mostly because of
phantomjs.
Export all images with Make
make
Yup, that simple. Runs:

build - builds the docker container
docker - preps the container for repeat access, mounts volumes, etc.
images - processes all the images

Makefile options
Custom /out directory
After you have built the container, you can customize the /out directory
if you do not want all the PNGs to show up here.  Be sure the directory
exists first.
Use the OUT=directory argument to send the PNGs elsewhere.
Example: Output PNGs to the /tmp directory
make OUT=/tmp docker
make images
Change the PNG export options
Same options as shakiba/svgexport.
After you have built (make build) and started the container (make docker),
you can customize the options for the PNGs if you want them at a different
resolution.
Use the OPTS=options argument to modify the PNGs prior to export.
Example: Resize all images to max 24px wide
make OPTS=24: images
Example: Resize all images to max 128px tall
make OPTS=:128 images
