Quantification and Understanding

I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about,
and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you
cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your
knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind; it may be the
beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely, in your thoughts,
advanced to the stage of \emph{science}, whatever the matter may be.

Number of total participants in group presentations
Number of reference transactions
On-site visits to the libraries
Reserve course readings (electronic and print)
Number of student research journals published by Library
Reservations of student collaborative spaces


Make a significant and visible societal impact    
Total number of filled ILL requests provided to other libraries
Count of books in Google Books and HathiTrust
IDEALS downloads
Curated exhibits on- or off-campus, incl. in libraries and
  partnerships with Krannert
Number of "last copy" items added to print repository from
  Illinois libraries



ServQual Instrument
From [@nitecki_changing_1996]
\textbf{Reliability} (Statements 5 through 9)

When excellent libraries’ ILL units promise to do something by a
   certain time, they will do so.
When a user has a problem, excellent libraries’ ILL units will show
   a sincere interest in solving it.
Excellent libraries will perform ILL services right the first time.
Excellent libraries will provide ILL services at the time they
   promise to do so.
Excellent libraries’ ILL units will insist on error-free records.

Factors informing the design of a scaling method

Basic philosophy of measurement [@michell90]
Operationalism
Representational Theory
Aristotelian


Geometric Interpretation of Data (Coombs model: see [@jacoby1991data]
Items being related interpreted as elements of same set vs. different sets.
Pair relationship interpreted as partial order vs. proximity.


Scaling model assumptions (see [@mciver1981unidimensional])
Thurstonian scaling
Likert scaling
Guttman scaling
Coombs unfolding model
(many others)



Scaling Models

ISO 9001 Requirements for Quality Management Systems
There's a lot more to these. See [@balague2011managing].

Address statutory and regulatory requirements.
Identify organizational processes relevant to quality management.
Identify and document criteria for the effectiveness of those processes.
Ensure the availability of resources for those processes.
Monitor, measure, and analyze the processes.
Take actions to ensure continued improvement.
