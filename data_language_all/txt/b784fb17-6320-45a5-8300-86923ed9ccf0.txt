Implement Tables

Implement Master & Slave DAO

Implement Master & Slave DAOs

Note: By using the Master and Slave roles, we can ensure that read, write, and transaction operations can only happen on the appropriate database. For example, when creating scalable relational database infrastructure where there is one master database and several slave databases where only read operations are allowed.
Write on Master Database

Write on Slave Database (Error)

Note: See the Master / Slave privileges here SlickHasPrivilege
