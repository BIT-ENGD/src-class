DAPS mTLS

...or yet another way to lose your sanity

This dir contains dev certificates and keys we use for testing mutual
TLS between the adapter and the mock DAPS service.
Adapter goodies

adapter.key-pair.pem: 2048-bit RSA pub/pvt key pair without key
  encryption so it isn't password protected.
adapter.pub.pem: pub key extracted from above pair.
adapter.minikube.crt.pem: self-signed, 10-year-valid X509 certificate
  with above key and host of orionadapterservice.istio-system, i.e. where
  the adapter gets deployed in the local Minikube cluster.
adapter.localhost.crt.pem: self-signed, 10-year-valid X509 certificate
  with above key and host of localhost. Comes in handy for running the
  adapter locally outside of Minikube's cluster.

Mock DAPS service goodies

mockdaps.key-pair.pem: 2048-bit RSA pub/pvt key pair without key
  encryption so it isn't password protected.
mockdaps.pub.pem: pub key extracted from above pair.
mockdaps.minikube.crt.pem: self-signed, 10-year-valid X509 certificate
  with above key and host of mockdaps.default, i.e. where mock
  DAPS gets deployed in the local Minikube cluster.
mockdaps.localhost.crt.pem: self-signed, 10-year-valid X509 certificate
  with above key and host of localhost. Comes in handy for running mock
  DAPS locally outside of Minikube's cluster.

How stuff got generated
Generate 2048-bit RSA pub/pvt key pair for the adapter without encrypting
the pvt key so it isn't password protected.
$ openssl genrsa -out adapter.key-pair.pem 2048

View/extract pub key:
$ openssl rsa -in adapter.key-pair.pem -pubout | less
$ openssl rsa -in adapter.key-pair.pem -pubout -out adapter.pub.pem

Generate self-signed, 10-year-valid adapter certificate tied to hostname
of orionadapterservice.istio-system:
$ openssl req -key adapter.key-pair.pem -new -x509 -days 3650 \
    -subj "/C=ZA/ST=Western Cape/L=Cape Town/O=Rusks Ltd/OU=Ma/CN=orionadapterservice.istio-system" \
    -out adapter.minikube.crt.pem

View plain-text cert:
$ openssl x509 -text -noout -in adapter.minikube.crt.pem | less

As you're at it, generate another one for localhost:
$ openssl req -key adapter.key-pair.pem -new -x509 -days 3650 \
    -subj "/C=ZA/ST=Western Cape/L=Cape Town/O=Rusks Ltd/OU=Ma/CN=localhost" \
    -out adapter.localhost.crt.pem

Generate mock DAPS service stuff in the same way:
$ openssl genrsa -out mockdaps.key-pair.pem 2048
$ openssl rsa -in mockdaps.key-pair.pem -pubout -out mockdaps.pub.pem
$ openssl req -key mockdaps.key-pair.pem -new -x509 -days 3650 \
    -subj "/C=ZA/ST=Western Cape/L=Cape Town/O=Rusks Ltd/OU=Ma/CN=mockdaps.default" \
    -out mockdaps.minikube.crt.pem
$ openssl req -key mockdaps.key-pair.pem -new -x509 -days 3650 \
    -subj "/C=ZA/ST=Western Cape/L=Cape Town/O=Rusks Ltd/OU=Ma/CN=localhost" \
    -out mockdaps.localhost.crt.pem
