ADFS example applications for processing and testing.

ADFS (Active Distributed File System) is a file system where the contents of a file can be the result of a computation performed over the contents of a collection of other files, allowing intermediate or final computations be stored in files and reused by other computations. The ADFS system is implemented as a middleware system combining a distributed file system and distributed processing. The system deals automatically with events that change the processing results used by applications during their execution to ensure low latency without unnecessarily increasing the number of computations performed.
