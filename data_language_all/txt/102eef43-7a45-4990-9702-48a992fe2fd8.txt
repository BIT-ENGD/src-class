grunt-pandoc
Inspired by Takazudo's custom coffeescript gruntjs task to make a gruntjs task for pandoc. 
At the moment, it only compiles markdown documents to html. Additional features may be implemented in the future. 
As a practical example, grunt would compile the pandoc user guide within some_notes folder to an html file of the same name in the same directory.
Note: do npm install
