My little personal game engine for personal and maybe in the future commercial projects. The Engine is supposed to be crossplatform, but currently runs on Linux but Im working on it.
Contributions in form of Pull Requests are welcome if you want to know more about how to contribute take a look into the Contribute section.
If you just want to build the engine look into Compile.
(Future) Features

Multithreaded
Cross-platform
Modern C++
Extremly Customizeable
Scripting with Lua
2D/3D Rendering with OpenGL (Maybe Vulkan in the future)
2D/3D Physics
Entity-Component-System
Unit Tests
Profiling
CI

Compile
Compiling the engine should be pretty straight forward using CMake. All the currently required libraries are shipped with the engine using git submodules.
Requirements

CMake
C++ Compiler with C++17 support
At least OpenGL 3.3 supporting GPU

Build Steps
git clone https://github.com/manimax3/Tronus.git
cd Tronus
git submodule init && git submodule update
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && cmake --build .
make install
Done
Contribute
Contibutions in form of spell corrections, bug fixes, feature additons, etc. are always welcome. Especially for people who want to get into C++ development.
In order to contribute just fork the engine, make your changes and create a pull request. I would appreciate if you format the code using the provided .clang-format and create a little test if there isnt one.
If you don't know what you could work on just take a look at my Trello.
