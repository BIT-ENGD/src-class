
A simple hangman game in Rust.
The game will try and detect if the OS is a Unix-like OS and try to see if /usr/share/dict/words can be used. If not, the bundled file, words.txt will be used instead.
The game will automatically load the entire file in memory, and randomly pick the words fulfilling the minimum and maximum word length constraints. If you so desire, you can replace the words.txt file with your own words.txt file (note that the name must be the same).
Usage
$ ./hangman [max-word-length = 24] [number-of-attempts = 10] (on UNIX-like systems)
or
$ hangman.exe [max-word-length = 24] [number-of-attempts = 10] (on Windows)
The minimum word length is set at 5 (not changeable). The minimum number of attempts is set at 10 (can be changed), and the maximum at 100 (not changeable).
Build instructions
Download the zip file or clone the project. Then from the command-line, change into the project's root directory.
$ cd hangman
$ cargo build
$ cargo run [max-word-length = 24] [number-of-attempts = 10]
Alternatively, the executable located in target/debug/ can be used in the manner shown in the Usage section.
