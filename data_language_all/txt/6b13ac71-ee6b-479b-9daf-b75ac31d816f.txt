FamilyShoppingList
This is a simple shopping list app for a family (or other group). Ready for pilot testing. 
Benefits / features:
- You can add shopping items so that all the family members can see them just be refreshing the list
- In the shop, you just can just tap the check box or its text and it will disappear from the list. Thus you don't have to read the whole (possibly long) shopping list many times while you are in the shop but the list gets shorter all the time which makes it much easier to read -> which means: quicker and less stressful shopping experience!
- You can prioritize shopping items on the right with red icon (e.g. if you have just part of the items that you are going to buy on that day)
- Items are automatically sorted by priority and alphabet so the items are quick to find.
- You can also edit items by long press
You just need one gmail account. You can create a new gmail account for your family usage (recommended) or use some 
existing one. So all the users of the family should use one and only one gmail account for this app. That account 
specifies shopping items of your family in the cloud database.
Future improvements that can come or not :)
- More sophisticated group functionality where each user could use his/her own gmail account and create his/her own groups. 
- Facebook login
- Other login solution (without gmail or Facebook)
- Accidentally completed (deleted) shopping items you should be able to bring back during e.g. one hour or day
- Push notifications when other user adds items. With settings you can either decide to receive them or not, and send them or not).
- Functionality without internet (automatic syncing when connection comes back)
