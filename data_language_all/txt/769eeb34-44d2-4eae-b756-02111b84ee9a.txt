Get Started
To get started, define a secrets.js file with the following structure:
module.exports = {
    PG: {
        app: {
            user: 'application',
            password: 'application_password'
        },
        superuser: {
            user: 'internal',
            password: 'internal_password'
        }
    }
}

Be sure to change the user names and passwords appropriately.
