PlanarMaps
PlanarMaps.jl is package for doing basic operations with planar maps (e.g., computing faces, inserting edges, etc.), drawing straight-line grid embeddings of them using Schnyder's algorithm, and generating random planar maps. 
julia
P = PlanarMap([
    [2,12,10,3],
    [12,1,3,4,5],
    [10, 11, 8, 5, 4, 2, 1],
    [5,2,3],
    [6,12,2,4,3,8,9,7],
    [12,5,7],
    [12,6,5,9,11],

    [7,5,8,11],
    [1,12,11,3],

    [10,1,2,5,6,7,11]])
