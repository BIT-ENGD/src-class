Version 0.0.7 (2019-09-02)

Update the README to indicate with which version of the nightly compiler Smithy is compatible.
Make Smithy more efficient: remove unnecessary code in the expansion of the smd! and smd_borrowed! macros, and move some path manipulation to compile time.

Version 0.0.6 (2019-08-08)

Update the README to point users to the create-smithy-app[https://github.com/rbalicki2/create-smithy-app/]
  repository.
Got rid of some compiler warnings.
Do not call console_error_panic_hook in Smithy.

Version 0.0.5 (2019-07-08)
Features

Now works with rustc 1.37.0-nightly (8ebd67e4e 2019-06-27) due to
  the smd! macro using a file cache instead of an in-memory cache

Version 0.0.4 (2019-06-26)
Features and breaking changes

Renamed smd_no_move! to smd_borrowed!
Cache calls to smd! and smd_borrowed! to improve compile times
Rename the "debug-logs" feature to "browser-logs"
