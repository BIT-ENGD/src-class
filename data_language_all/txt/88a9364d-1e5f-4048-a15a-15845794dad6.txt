oj.lisp
Online Judge Submit Script written by Common Lisp.
Study for Common Lisp and ContextL
Only tested on Clozure CL 64bit on Mac OS 10.7.4
Requirements
Following Common Lisp libraries are required:

CL-PPCRE
S-HTTP-CLIENT
DRAKMA
ContextL

You can easily install these libraries by using Quicklisp.
Download Quicklisp and eval following codes in your Common Lisp system.
(load "quicklisp.lisp")
(quicklisp-quickstart:install)
(ql:add-to-init-file)
(ql:quickload :cl-ppcre)
(ql:quickload :s-http-client)
(ql:quickload :drakma)
(ql:quickload :contextl)

Usage
First, you should create "setting.lisp" file.
This file contains Online Judge site's configuration.
(defvar setting
    '((poj . ((user . "username")
              (pass . "password")
              (ext-lang-map . (("cpp" . "G++") ("cc" . "G++") ("c" . "GCC") ("java" . "Java")))))
      (aoj . ((user . "username")
              (pass . "password")
              (ext-lang-map . (("cpp" . "C++11") ("cc" . "C++11") ("c" . "C") ("java" . "JAVA")))))
      ))

ext-lang-map specifies which extension corresponds to "language" field element.
Then you can run this script by following command.
$ ccl64 --load oj.lisp -- poj submit 1000

Command is defined formally by
$ ccl64 --load oj.lisp -- <judge> <command> <number>

where arguments are below:
