MACHINE: TRINITY
Trinity dotfiles
These are the dotfiles for tinity, which I maintain myself and are for personal use, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
To automatically symlink all the files you want to symlink to your home
directory add an entry to the install file inside this directory.
Symlinking is done by the script dotfiles-install.
Requirements
Terminal supporting 256-colors
