meaning
A mini blogging platform inspired by MEAN.JS. 
~~The name of this repo means that I'm still learning MEAN.JS and falling in love with it.~~(see here)
~~Live Demo~~
Prerequisites
I think you should have some basic knowledge about MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js in advance.  
You can go through their official websites directly, or view MEAN.IO Repo / MEAN.JS Repo for reference.
Tips: The history of MEAN.IO and MEAN.JS.
I also use ~~CoffeeScript and~~ LESS as the front-end precompiler.
And the crucial tool to run MEAN.JS application is Grunt, which will automate your development process.
Make sure you have installed Node.js and npm, then install grunt globally via npm:
$ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
What is more, make sure MongoDB is running on the default port 27017.
Installation
$ git clone https://github.com/just4fun/meaning.git
$ cd meaning
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt
Grunt Commands
$ grunt
Default command, which will build application without minification and uglificaion, then run it.
$ grunt -release
Build application with minification and uglificaion, then run it.
$ grunt build
Build application without minification and uglificaion.
$ grunt build -release
Build application with minification and uglificaion.
$ grunt build-server
Only build server code.
$ grunt run
Run application immediately. 
This command is always executed after $ grunt build (-release)
Host
You should rewrite /login and /admin in web server when you want to host meaning.  
For example, if you use nginx, you should add these two lines into your nginx config file.
rewrite ^/admin/?$ /admin/admin-index.html break;
rewrite ^/login/?$ /admin/admin-login.html break;
Default User
Account: admin 
Password: 12345
More
This mini site only has basic posting function now, and there are bugs inevitably~~, I will improve it during the time I spend on learning MEAN.JS~~.(see here)
Just for fun
Updated in 2015
Since there are so many amazing stuff appeared in frontend community this year, and Angular has been developed to 2.0 which is an entirely new framework. Therefore, I won't want to add new features or refactor existed functionalities to this repo except updating the ugly UI layout. Thanks to MEAN.JS, I learned lots of things from it.
