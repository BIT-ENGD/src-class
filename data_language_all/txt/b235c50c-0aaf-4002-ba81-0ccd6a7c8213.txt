Scope
This project aims to provide a Object Oriented Javascript application framework that attempts to find as much unity as possible between serverside and clientside code. The aim is to decrease duplication of effort as well as code by:
  * building views that can be rendered by both server and client
  * constructing server and client models with common interfaces so client and server can share actions
  * generating (configurable) RESTful APIs for every model
  * providing named routes and a single set of route configurations
To Do
