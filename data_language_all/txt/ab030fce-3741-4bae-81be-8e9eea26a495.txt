Instructions for compiling CASTEP 17.2.1 for CSD3-Skylake using Intel 16 compilers
These instructions are for compiling CASTEP 17.2,1 on CSD3-Skylake using the Intel 17 compilers
and Intel MPI 17.
We assume that you have obtained the CASTEP source code from the UKCP developers.
Unpack the CASTEP source code
Unpack the source
bash
tar -xvf CASTEP-17.21.tar.gz
Setup correct modules
Load the FFTW 3 module:
bash
module load fftw/intel/64/3.3.3
Create the arch file for Intel MPI
CASTEP 17.2.1 does not contain a configuration file for using Intel MPI so this
needs to be created. Switch to the platform files directory and copy the base
Linux Intel 17 file:
bash
cd CASTEP-17.21/obj/platforms
cp linux_x86_64_ifort17.mk linux_x86_64_ifort17-IMPI.mk
Edit linux_x86_64_ifort17-IMPI.mk to set the MPI compilers to pick up the 
Intel compilers rather than GCC::
ifeq ($(COMMS_ARCH),mpi)
CC  = mpiicc
F90 = mpiifort
Edit the Makefile to set options
Switch to the main CASTEP directory
bash
cd CASTEP-17.21
Edit Makefile and set the following options
COMMS_ARCH := mpi
FFT := fftw3
BUILD := fast
MATHLIBS := mkl10
The architecture detection does not work correctly either so you need to comment out all the
lines set ARCH and hard code this:

Build CASTEP
Find the path to the MKL libraries (needed for compile step)
bash
echo $MKLROOT
Build CASTEP using the following commands:
bash
unset CPU
make -j8 CASTEP_ARCH=linux_x86_64_ifort17-IMPI clean
make -j8 CASTEP_ARCH=linux_x86_64_ifort17-IMPI
The install process will ask for the path to the BLAS and LAPACK libraries. Use the path
you found above with /lib/intel64 appended to the end, i.e.:
/opt/intel/parallel_studio_xe_2016_ce_u2/compilers_and_libraries_2016.2.181/linux/mkl/lib/intel64
You will also be asked for the path to FFTW; just leave this blank.
Install CASTEP
To install the binaries in a specified directory use:
bash
make -j8 INSTALL_DIR=/home/y07/y07/castep/16.1.2-intel/bin install
If you wish to simply install into the bin/ directory in the CASTEP source
tree you can simply use:
bash
make -j8 install
The built binary is called castep.mpi.
