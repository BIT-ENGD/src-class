Sky Models
Point Sources
For the OVRO LWA the two most important point sources for calibration are Cas
A and Cyg A,
which are the two brightest sources on the sky. The optimal time to solve for a calibration is when
both of these sources are above the horizon.
Currently TTCal expects the sky model to be specified as a list of point sources.  This is
accomplished by listing the sources in a JSON file.  For example the
following file defines a sky model consisting of Cas A and Cyg A using the published spectra for
Baars et al. 1977.
[
    {
        "ref": "Baars et al. 1977",
        "name": "Cas A",
        "ra": "23h23m24s",
        "dec": "58d48m54s",
        "I": 555904.26,
        "Q": 0.0,
        "U": 0.0,
        "V": 0.0,
        "freq": 1.0e6,
        "index": [-0.770]
    },
    {
        "ref": "Baars et al. 1977",
        "name": "Cyg A",
        "ra": "19h59m28.35663s",
        "dec": "+40d44m02.0970s",
        "I": 49545.02,
        "Q": 0.0,
        "U": 0.0,
        "V": 0.0,
        "freq": 1.0e6,
        "index": [+0.085,-0.178]
    }
]
There are many tools available for reading and writing JSON files
(Julia,
Python).  These tools can be used to generate a sky
model using your favorite programming language.
Fields:

ref is not used by TTCal, but is intended to be a record of the origin
  of the information used to define the source
name is the name of the source
ra and dec define the J2000 location of the source
I, Q, U, and V define the Stokes parameters (in Jy) at the frequency freq (in Hz)
  Q, U, and V are optional and will be assumed to be zero if they are not given
index defines the spectral index of the source (and higher order terms)

Higher order terms are defined such that
[
    \log_{10} I = \log_{10} I_0 + \sum_{n=1}^N \alpha_n \log_{10}\left(\frac{\nu}{\nu_0}\right)^n
]
where $I_0$ is the Stokes-I flux at the reference frequency and $\alpha_n$ represents
the values contained in index.
!!! note
    The Sun, the Moon, and Jupiter are special cases. These solar system objects do not need to have
    their position specified. TTCal will automatically determine their location based on the current
    time. This works based on the name of the source.  If you name a source "Sun", "Moon", or
    "Jupiter" it will be placed at the correct location.
Gaussian Sources
Gaussians sources can be added to the sky model by defining major-fwhm, minor-fwhm, and
position-angle.

major-fwhm is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the major axis in arcseconds
minor-fwhm is the FWHM of the minor axis in arcseconds
position-angle is the angle the major axis makes with J2000 north where a positive angle is east of north

Note that the Stokes parameters I, Q, U, and V now give the integrated flux
over the entire source. An example Gaussian source is given below:
...
    {
        "ref": "Michael's imagination",
        "name": "A Gaussian source",
        "ra": "12h34m56.78s",
        "dec": "+12d34m56.78s",
        "I": 123.45,
        "freq": 70e6,
        "index": [-0.770],
        "major-fwhm": 200,
        "minor-fwhm": 100,
        "position-angle": -70
    }
    ...
Multi-Component Sources
When peeling sources with TTCal each source receives its own peeling solution. This is not always
the desired behavior. For example if you are trying to peel Cyg A you might want to use two sources
to describe the two radio lobes, but both sources should be peeled with the same solution.
Multi-component sources allow you to define sources that are composed of any number of the other
source types. For example:
...
    {
        "name": "Cyg A",
        "components": [
            {
                "name": "east lobe",
                ...
            },
            {
                "name": "west lobe",
                ...
            }
        ]
    }
    ...
RFI Sources
TTCal allows the possibility that some sources may not originate from the far-field of the
interferometer. That is, some sources may be so close to the interferometer that the curvature of
the incoming wavefront cannot be neglected. The exact transition between the near-field and
far-field depends on the wavelength, the maximum baseline of the inteferometer, and the desired
dynamic range. In order to correctly account for near-field effects TTCal needs the longitude,
latitude, and elevation of the source.
!!! note
    The ITRF coordinate system requires the distance to the center of the Earth in place of the
    elevation.
Sources that do live in the near-field are likely sources of radio frequency interference (RFI), and
therefore do not have the smooth power-law spectra expected of astronomical sources.  Specifying the
flux of an RFI source therefore requires you to give a list of frequencies and the flux at that
frequency. For example:
...
    {
        "name": "Noisy Power Lines"
        "sys": "WGS84",
        "long": -118.31478,
        "lat": 37.14540,
        "el": 1226.709,
        "rfi-frequencies": [3.0e7, 3.75e7, 4.5e7, 5.25e7, 6.0e7],
        "rfi-I": [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
    }
    ...
The longitude and latitude must be given in degrees and the elevation (or distance from the center
of the Earth) must be given in meters. The only valid coordinate systems are currently WGS84 and
ITRF.  You may optionally also supply the fields rfi-Q, rfi-U, and rfi-V to specify the
corresponding Stokes parameters for the RFI emission.
