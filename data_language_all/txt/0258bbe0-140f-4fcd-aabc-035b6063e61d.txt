Apps
These are network-aware peer2peer applications.  The clients and servers find eachother via a centralized rendezvous server on a known host.
capture_client
Dynamic library for reuse by other applications:
+ Receives stream from a capture_server.
+ Records stream to disk.
+ Replays streams from disk. <= Useful for end-user applications.
capture_server
Reads cameras, compresses the video, and transmits it.
GUI application that connects to a rendezvous_server, allowing viewer and other applications to view streams from attached cameras.
Video data is protected by a password.
rendezvous_server
Console application that capture_client and capture_server connect to.
This allows a single capture_client to receive time-synched video from multiple capture_server computers.
viewer
GUI application that connects to the rendezvous_server and then connects to all capture_servers available.
xrcap_csharp
C# wrapper around the capture_client API, allowing the client to be used from Unity on Windows.
