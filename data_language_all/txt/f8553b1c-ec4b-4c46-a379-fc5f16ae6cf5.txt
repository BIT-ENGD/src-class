To Discuss

Hoare logic + Communicating sequential processes
awesome idea for IPC : hash attached to a process when it is launched, generated from file path and/or file content
unique (even among versions of a same program)
constant
based on system calls
does program $NAME exists ?
is it running ?
what is its hash ?
initiate communication
or same thing but with hash instead




firm RTOS : hard for kernel/services, soft for applications ?
generate scheduling algorithm with machine learning (feat. Nirmalie Wiratunga)
literature review deadline extended to 11th midnight
