VectorizedRoutines.jl
 
VectorizedRoutines.jl provides a library of familiar and useful vectorized routines. This package hopes to include high-performance, tested, and documented  Julia implementations  of routines which MATLAB/Python/R users would be familiar with. We also welcome generally useful routines for operating on vectors/arrays.
Installation
To install the package, simply use:
julia
Pkg.add("VectorizedRoutines")
using VectorizedRoutines
For the latest features, switch to the master branch via:
julia
Pkg.checkout("VectorizedRoutines")
Using the Package
The functions from R/Python/MATLAB are implemented in order to match the functionality
of their appropriate packages. In order to not have namespace issues, they are
contained in appropriate modules, so you would call the MATLAB functions like:
julia
mgrid = Matlab.meshgrid(0:1//4:1,0:1//8:1)
and the R functions like:
julia
v1=1:5
v2 = 5:-1:1
repped = R.rep(v1,v2)
Although these look like they are calling some outside package from these languages,
they are bonafide Julia implementations and thus can handle Julia specific issues
(like using Rational numbers in the meshgrid).
If you want to export the functions to the main namespace, simply use the commands like this:
julia
using VectorizedRoutines.R
rpois(1,[5.2;3.3]) # Same as R.rpois(1,[5.2;3.3])

Python

@vcomp (vector comprehension) macro based on Python's list comprehensions
with a conditional clause to filter elements in a succinct way, ie: @vcomp Int[i^2 for i in 1:10] when i % 2 == 0    # Int[4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
