IPNets.jl




IPNets.jl is a Julia package that provides IP network types. Both IPv4 and IPv6
networks can be described with IPNets.jl using standard, intuitive syntax.
Main Features
An important aspect of IPNets.jl is the ability to treat IP networks as
vectors while not actually allocating the memory required to store a full
range of addresses. Common vector operations such as membership testing and
indexing are fully supported with IPNet types. The following examples should
help clarify:
create a network with 24-bit netmask

length, indexing, and iteration

equality
julia> ip4net[5] == ip4
true
minima / maxima

alternate construction and subset comparison

memory usage is minimal (476 bytes to represent the entire IPv4 address space)

Though these examples use the IPv4Net type, the IPv6Net type is also available with similar behavior.
Known Issues

Extrema measurements for IPNets representing the entire IPv4 or IPv6 address
space will fail due to overrun of the native type used to describe the networks.
Non-contiguous subnetting for IPv4 addresses (e.g., a netmask of "255.240.255.0")
is not supported. Subnets must be able to be represented as a series of contiguous mask bits.
