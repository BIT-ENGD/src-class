A collection of tools for command-line mysql db administration.
Recommended usage:
Drop the db.tools directory somewhere.  Then either put this directory in your PATH or symlink each script into directory that is in your path.  I personally use the latter approach.
Usage:
db -    a command-line tool to make working with one or more mysql instances easier.

It supports tab completion.

examples:


list the schemata in the "foo" mysql instance
db foo ls


list the mysql instances it finds on the current host
db tag


list available commands in context
db <space> <tab>


list the schemata in foo that start with a "b"
db foo cli b<tab>


start a mysql command-line instance in the schema bar
db foo cli bar


show table defn of bar.acct
db foo ls bar acct


show code for setup of credentials for accessing the db as root
db auth-set root


setup credentials for accessing the db as root
eval "$( db auth-set root )"




setup the tools:
cd /baz/bin
git clone git://github.com/bugi/db.tools.git
ln -s db.tools/db .
cd db.tools/db.conf
cp -a default this
cp -p pool/local.params this/
cat this/setup  # edit to your taste
cat this/local.params   # edit to your taste
. /baz/db.tools/db.conf/pool/completion_dbtool  # add to your bashrc

setup mysql instance for use with tool:
For the typical single-instance install, copy the db.tools/example/dbtool_conf file into your mysql data directory.  Edit this/local.params to make the tool find your mysql data directory.
security:
Although this tool tries not to expose your credentials, it is best not to use this tool in other than a trusted environment.
It is assumed that the unix user you run as can read the mysql data dir and the dbtool_conf file.  It need not be able to read the schema directories.  To make this secure, use unix groups and/or make your machine difficult to compromise.
customization:
The tool is decomposed into modules on purpose.  The authentication system is especially customizable.
If you come up with a better auth system, please share...
More/better documentation welcome.
