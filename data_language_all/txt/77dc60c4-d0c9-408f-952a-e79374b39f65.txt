This is a repository designed to introduce basic Julia applications for econometrics. The folders included are as follows:

dataframes: Basic introduction to Julia's dataframes capabilities
DDC: An attempt at solving a dynamic discrete choice model
JuMP: Various applications of Julia's JuMP package (which is a modelling language that interfaces with a variety of industry-grade optimizers). Subfolders are as follows:
mlogit: classic multinomial logit with alternative-specific parameters, estimated with and without constraints
normal: maximum likelihood estimation of the classical normal linear model
xtlogit: a (currently unsuccessful) attempt at a binary logit with random effects
xtlogitNoHet: binary logit with no random effects
xtlogitSimple: another attempt at a binary logit with random effects


loopVsMatmul: a speed test for matrix multiplication in loop versus vectorized form
mlogit: Vestigial version of JuMP/mlogit/, before I discovered JuMP
ols: basic OLS in Julia
save: simple example for reading .mat (Matlab) files into Julia and saving Julia objects into .mat files
