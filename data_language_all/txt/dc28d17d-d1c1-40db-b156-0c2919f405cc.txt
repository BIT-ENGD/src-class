forceMap

This is a package to create force directed maps in R.  Inspiration and code starting point (in D3) credited to Aaron Bycoffe's block: http://bl.ocks.org/bycoffe/3230965. 
The idea is to create a map-like visualization that reflects differences in numeric values.  In practice, a circle is drawn for each country in a data set with the radius proportional to some value (population, gdp, etc. are common, but use your imagination!).  Then, each circle is tethered to a point on an imaginary map based on lat/lon coordinates.  Finally, a physical simulation lets the circles rearrange themselves.  This results in imperfect placement of countries, but everything should be in the right general area.
If you are interested in a method that maintains strict geographic integrity, use choropleth maps (boring...).
Known Issues

Doesn't display great in R Studio windows - adjust sizing if you want to visualize it there.  Otherwise, just use a browser.
Some countries not in the included database, which causes errors. (looking to fix soon)

Install
{r}
require(devtools)
devtools::install_github("iankloo/forceMap")
Use
I included some sample data so you can see what kind of data definitely works.
```{r}
library(forceMap)
df <- forceMapSample
forceMap(df)
{r}
library(shiny)
library(forceMap)
shinyUI(fluidPage(
  forceMapOutput('map'),
  sliderInput('proj', 'Map Projection Scale', min=300, max=3000, value=1500),
  sliderInput('minRad', 'Minimum Circle Radius', min=5, max=100, value=10),
  sliderInput('maxRad', 'Maximum Circle Radius', min=10, max=200, value=40)
  )
)
{r}
df <- forceMapSample
server <- function(input, output, session) {
output$map <- renderForceMap({
    forceMap(df, minRadius=input$minRad, maxRadius=input$maxRad, projScale=input$proj)
  })
}
```
