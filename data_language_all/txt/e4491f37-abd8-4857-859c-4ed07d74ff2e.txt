Frontend of the game Avioneta
About the game
Avioneta is a multiplayer game where players fight to destroy its opponents. The game runs in the browser using HTML5 technologies like WebSockets and Canvas.
The game is architectured in a client-server fashion where the client send commands to the server to update the game state.
The code for the server of the game is on this other repository: https://github.com/madtrick/avioneta-server
About the frontend
The frontend reacts to user actions updating its game state, redrawing the game-world and sending the user actions to the server encapsulated as commands.
The frontend does not use any framework or game engine to do the rendering, game state handling or other gaming related actions. Everything was built from scratch just as a pedagogical experience for myself.
