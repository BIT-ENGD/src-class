In play the Result type plays an important role. Actions in controllers
solely deal with mapping a Request to a Result. This gives Result a
special status in the context of this library.
That's why we have provided aliases for commands and their aliases prefilled
with Result as their branch type.

You can access the specialized container directly if you wish.
