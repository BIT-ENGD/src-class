Printer ink dry up ?
This is simple bash script to print test page via cron job with all colors to prevent cartridges from drying out.
I don't use printer a lot so ink dried up in my last one so i had to buy another one(cleaning didn't work for me).
That's why i wrote this piece of code to print test page every 15 days(you can change it via firs parameter).
Installation

pull repo
check your printer name(needed for second parameter PrinterName)

0 * * * * (cd /path/to/project/printer-ink-dry-up; sh print.sh 1296000 PrinterName)



save cron job

Cron running every hour and check 'printing_automation.log' for last printed time.
