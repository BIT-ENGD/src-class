                launch(UI) { result.proceed().let { handlePermissionResult(it) } }
            }
            .setNegativeButton("Deny") { _, _ ->
                launch(UI) { result.cancel().let { handlePermissionResult(it) } }
            }
            .setCancelable(false)
            .setMessage("You should explain why your app requests the permissions.")
