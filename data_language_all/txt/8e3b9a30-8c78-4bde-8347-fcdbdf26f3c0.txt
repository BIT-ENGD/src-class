cg.jl - Computational Graphs in Julia


cg.jl is a project to (1) learn Julia, and (2) explore the practical considerations of implementing a deep learning framework.
For now, it only supports CPU computation and the design/API is still in flux (currently a strange cross of Theano, CGT, and Tensorflow).  Many basic operations are implemented, and the next step is to simplify the design and clean up the code.
In the future, I hope to explore graph optimizations, running graphs on a GPU, make better use of Julia's metaprogramming abilities, and experiment with Julia's distributed computing tools.
Softmax Regression
Simple example showing what softmax regression looks like (in test/nn.jl)
