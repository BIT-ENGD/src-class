Get started
To get started, open sbt in this example project, and issue the task
~fastOptJS.
You can now open target\scala-2.11\index-dev.html in your favorite Web browser!
The optimized version
Instead of running fastOptJS, you can also run fullOptJS to generate
a much more compact version of the JavaScript code. While target\scala-2.11\index-dev.html
refers to the JavaScript emitted by fastOptJS, target\scala-2.11\index.html refers to the
optimized JavaScript emitted by fullOptJS.
