Quick RDoc is a Chrome Extension which makes it easier to search the ruby-doc.org
repository.
Usage
Example usage: rdoc (press tab) ar
After pressing enter you are taken to the Array page in Ruby-Doc.
Installation
Install from Chrome Web Store at the following URL:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quick-rdoc/eimmoalljodgaailhdnaleihnahcpaom?hl=en&gl=US
Options
Open the options page to set the version of Ruby you are searching for. Once 
saved Quick RDoc will only display classes for your version of ruby.
Why
I love ruby-doc.org, it makes it easy to pull up documentation on the Core Ruby 
classes easy. However, after using ruby-doc.org multiple times per day I wanted 
a better way to quickly search the documentation.
TODO

~~Create settings page with options:~~ DONE
~~Set default Ruby version~~ DONE
Add Std-lib classes to the search
Allow user to change version in Omnibox (need to come up with syntax)
