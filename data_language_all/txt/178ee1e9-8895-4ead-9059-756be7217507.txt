Configuring the default values
The module comes with some pre-configured options for things like colors, size, stroke etc. If these
don't match your app's design, you can change the global defaults by using the RoundProgressConfig
service. Whenever an option isn't defined on a round-progress element, it's value will be taken
from the defaults.

Browser support

Internet Explorer 9+
Firefox 28.0+
Chrome 31+
Safari 5.1+
and pretty much any browser that supports SVG

Note: Some older browsers may require (a polyfill for requestAnimationFrame).
Read more about the requestAnimationFrame browser support.
Development

npm install to install development dependencies
gulp to run a development server. Not mandatory(you can run the build/index.html directly), but more convenient.
gulp module:build to build minified demo in build/
gulp deploy to do a build and push the demo to the gh-pages branch
