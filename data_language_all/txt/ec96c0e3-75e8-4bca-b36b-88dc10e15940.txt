Chrolo-Scripts
This is a repo of some scripts and stuff I've been (and will be) working on.
My scripts require my library to be available, which is mentioned below.
If you want to use it, go ahead. Be warned it may be buggy as shit.
Please report bugs to me on here, or on IRC. You can find me in #DameDesuYo
Change Alignment
from Chaotic to Lawful

These macros allows to change alignment of text whilst (attempting) to maintain it's position on screen.
It doesn't yet account for EVERYTHING, but accounts for text at an angle, spanning multiple lines with varying scales.
Also, text on multiple lines will obviously align against the new alignment. Only the widest line won't move.
if you need all the text to stay the same, split the lines by '\N' first, then apply this function.
Line breaker
Because breakups are hard

This is the line splitter I said I'd work on. It's mostly functional at the moment, though it has some tag problems.
Basically splits a line at all occurrences of '\N', attempting to maintain text position on screen and any style overrides in effect.
Restyler
Get changed, we're fansubbing here

Working on a BD originally done by ~~smereme~~ someone and it had a new style declared for every typeset.
It annoyed me so much that I made this macro: It allows you to select a bunch of lines and change them to another style, trying to maintain their current appearance
Chrolo's Library
You'll need this for ~~my change alignment macro~~ almost everything I make from here on.
Contains a bunch of useful functions, mainly around getting styles and parameters from lines and determine line sizes and bounding boxes co-ordinates.
The whole 'chrolo' folder should be placed in the 'includes' directory of your aegisub app data folder.
Maybe I'll get around to added depCtrl onto this all to make it easier.
Chrolo's shapeFactory
A collection of functions to generate shapes for you. Particularly useful for KFX or where shapes have lots of repetitive parts (like doing circles in circles in circles to create ripples).
Chrolo's KFX Library
This library contains functions and effects to create simple KFX.  
Current Effects:
- Shuffling Text
- Rainbow Text
- Bouncing Text to beat  
KFXExampleCode
This has some macros you can run to see what the library can do, whilst looking at the code to see how it did it.  
More will be added.
Chrolo's Quick KFX
This project aims to make KFX available to everyone.  
This is non functional at the moment
It will probably never be finished.
