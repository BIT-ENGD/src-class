Forms
Forms are tough things to do well and keep flexible. There are many
different forms libraries, especially for react, e.g., 
JS/TS:

https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik
https://github.com/final-form/react-final-form#-react-final-form which uses
https://final-form.org/ for form state management.

ReasonML:

https://github.com/MinimalHQ/re-formality
https://github.com/Astrocoders/reform
...many others...

This library is mtuch like formik, which is quite popular.
There are also dynamic generators that generate forms from metadata e.g. https://uniforms.tools/.
Oh my!
Example
Here's a not very good example using this library. It will get refactored as I
get time to update this README.
