maven-pom-mode
An EMACS major mode for editting maven pom files
I am creating this mode to pull together a lot of the ideas on pom editting from around the inter-tubes as well as to integreate with https://github.com/m0smith/malabar-mode via issue https://github.com/m0smith/malabar-mode/issues/92.
What it is good for

Integrates with nxml-mode for error highlighting and code completion.  
C-M-i give valid suggestions. 
C-c / will close a tag.
C-c i will complete an inline tag.
C-c b will complete an block tag.
C-c d will Search for artifacts in maven central and insert dependency tag via maven-pom-add-dependency.  Use a prefix (C-u) to prompt for a scope. 

Installation
From the shell:
git clone https://github.com/m0smith/maven-pom-mode.git
In Emacs:
(add-to-list 'load-path "path to maven-pom-mode")
(load "maven-pom-mode")
Acknowledgements
I am indeed standing on the shoulders of giants including:
*  torstein.k.johansen for nXML integration ideas and files
*  Dave Paroulek for the work on searching for artifacts in maven central (or other nexus repo)
