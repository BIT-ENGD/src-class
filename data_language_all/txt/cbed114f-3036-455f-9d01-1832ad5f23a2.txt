Example showing how to link against ROOT.
Prerequisite
If you are not using the standard software stack of your experiment, either CMS or the FCC, you can do a standalone installation in the following way. 
Install ROOT
you can compile root with cmake
On the mac:
- problem with pcre, so one has to use the built-in pcre.
- problem with ssl, deactivated
I managed to compile in the following way:
mkdir _build
cd _build
cmake .. -Dbuiltin_pcre=ON -Dssl=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/Users/cbern/local/root
make -j 4
Install FastJet
You can download it here
Then:
mkdir ~/local
./configure --prefix=$HOME/local
make -j 4
make install
export FASTJET_ROOT_DIR=$HOME/local
How external packages are found
Two cmake functions are used to find ROOT and fastjet when you run cmake.
These functions are provided by the ROOT and fastjet developers, and they are in the cmake/ directory.
The function FindROOT.cmake was found in $ROOTSYS/etc/cmake/.
The function FindFastjet.cmake was googled and found here
