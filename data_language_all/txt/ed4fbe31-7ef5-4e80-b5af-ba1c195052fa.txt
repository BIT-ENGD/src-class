WordPress Vagrant VM
Build a Ubuntu 16.04 Vagrant box running WordPress with Apache and MySQL.
Prerequisites
Vagrant installation : https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
Bash
Build it
bash
vagrant up
The installation may take a long time depending on your internet connection.
Access it
Go to http://192.168.33.10/
The page may take some time to load the first time after you build the vagrant box.
Command line
This WordPress installation uses the REST API plugin so you can access it with any rest client. 
The complete description of the API is here : http://v2.wp-api.org/reference/posts/
For convenience bash functions are provided to access the api. To use them go into the project directory after the vagrant box is built and run:
bash
. functions
To list all the posts:
bash
wpls
To add a new post from a json file:
bash
wpadd test.json
To remove a post by number:
bash
wprm 1
Or with curl
For example list all the posts with curl:
bash
curl http://192.168.33.10/wp-json/wp/v2/posts
Add a new post:
bahs
curl -u bob:bob -X POST  -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://192.168.33.10/wp-json/wp/v2/posts -d '{"title":"My new post", "status":"publish"}'
Or by passing a file instead:
bash
curl -u bob:bob -X POST  -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://192.168.33.10/wp-json/wp/v2/posts -d @file.json
Remove post number number 3:
bash
curl -u bob:bob -X DELETE http://192.168.33.10/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/3
Customisation
You can customise the WordPress user for the install before running vagrant up by changing the user, password or blog name in wpinstall file provided.
