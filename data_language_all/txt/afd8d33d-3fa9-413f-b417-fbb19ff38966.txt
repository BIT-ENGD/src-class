SCamPi
Security Camera (Raspberry) Pi
Start streaming a Logitech QuickCam UltraVision (http://support.logitech.com/en_us/product/quickcam-ultra-vision) and capture the stream as soon as the PIR detects motion. Save the captured files in the cloud.
Requirements

vlc and cvlc
uvcdynctrl (and import corresponding file: uvcdynctrl -i /usr/share/uvcdynctrl/data/046d/logitech.xml)
some more...

Hardware

Raspberry Pi 1,2,3,4 should all be supported at some point
PIR sensor
Logitech webcam (I'm using a QuicCam Ultra Vision camera but the concept should work on others too)
more...

TODO Part I

make init script stable (stop seems a bit flakey right now)
add the save-chinks functionality
hook up PIR motion detection to the chunked-stream-capture script
save the files to a auto-synced destination that uploads files to the "cloud"
check for connected device before trying to blink webcam LED
make it installable
add light sensor (i2c)
add Solid State Relay to turn on the lights
more...

TODO Part II

Create (android) app to:
get alerts when motion is detected
view live stream (with live audio)
turn off/on alarm when app is connected/disconnected from local network
turn on/off alarm through app
talk back (hook up speaker to Raspberry Pi) - is it even possible?
