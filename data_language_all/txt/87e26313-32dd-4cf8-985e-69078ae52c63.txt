jQuery Infinite Pages

A light-weight jQuery plugin for adding infinite scrolling to paginated HTML views
that tastes great with Rails and
Kaminari.
This project was originally designed for Rails, but the core plugin is flexible
enough to use anywhere.
Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:
ruby
gem 'jquery-infinite-pages'
And then execute:
bundle install
Add to your application.js file:
javascript
//= require jquery.infinite-pages
Non-Rails
Just copy the jquery.infinite-pages.js.coffee file from app/assets/javascripts to
wherever you want it.
Usage
jQuery Infinite Pages binds to an element containing a rel="next" pagination link and
watches for scroll events.
When the link is close to the bottom of the screen, an async request to the next page
is triggered. The server's response should then append the new page and update the
pagination link.

You can also manually control the firing of load events:

Rails/Kaminari Example
The following is an example of how to integrate this plugin into your Rails app
using Kaminari.
Set up pagination in lessons_controller.rb:
ruby
class LessonsController
  def index
    @lessons = Lesson.order('lessons.name ASC').page(params[:page])
  end
end
Write the template for your list of lessons in index.html.erb:

...and _lessons.html.erb:

Append new data to the table in index.js.erb:

At this point, the pagination link at the bottom of your table should allow you
to load the next page without refreshing. Finally, we trigger the next page load
with the infinitePages plugin in lessons.js.coffee:
coffee
$ ->
  # Configure infinite table
  $('.infinite-table').infinitePages
    # debug: true
    loading: ->
      $(this).text('Loading next page...')
    error: ->
      $(this).button('There was an error, please try again')
Voila! You should now have an infinitely long list of lessons.
