Projects and Technical Stuff

ScalaJS.

You can view some of my projects at GitHub. These are mostly toy things but you can get a feel of which technologies I like.

sojoe-dot-at is actually the source code for this site, which I write more about here.
twodee is a toy library featuring 2d shapes together with linear algebra. I demonstrate this here with JavaScript animations written in Scala. ScalaJS makes this possible.
ants is a very tiny little demo of Software Transactional Memory (STM) in Haskell. I basically just tried it out for an hour or two and was impressed. You can certainly find better demos of STM, but the technology itself is promising.
futureBack is a backup program written in Haskell which I did together with a friend for a uni course.
songmaker is a Haskell program which converts songs with chords written in a beginner-friendly custom format to LaTeX songbook.sty format. Together with Liedermappe I made it for the production of my church's song books.
