cepl-youtube-examples
This repo is a companion to cbaggers' CEPL and the videos on youtube demonstrating it.
CEPL is in active development, and a lot of wonderful changes had taken place since the videos were posted.  Most of the changes are great behind-the-scenes improvements.  In addition, the syntax has changed enough that the code shown in many videos will neither compile nor run.
Do not be disappointed - these changes are good!  Just follow code and the notes in this repo to work through the examples.
This document assumes that you are able to get CEPL to work well enough to see the triangle demo.  All the code requires you to do the following:
lisp
(ql:quickload :cepl.sdl2)
(cepl:repl)
(ql:quickload :cepl.examples)
(in-package :cepl.examples)
I will be adding more notes and code as time permits.  Please check back often or watch this repo.
