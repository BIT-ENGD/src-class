
This is currently made of two static HTML pages
run npm install and bower install to grab all dependencies

Webpack

Project uses webpack, so run npm start to run the equivilant to grunt dev

Style Guide
This App attempts to follow these guidelines https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react
It can be summerized here:
React Components

If there a state is being declared then use class ... extends React.Component {}.
A mixin is a reason not to use this though. Only when neccesarry use const ... = React.createComopnent({})

Naming

Always use the .jsx extension and PascalCase for React components
The parent directory should be named the same as the main component in that File e.g. ./Footer/Footer.jsx

Aligment

Indent element attributes so that they are easily readable.
Do not pad JSX attributes in curly braces
Leave a trailing white space before the closing of an element - it makes the closing parenthesis easier to find
e.g. <Foo
              superLongParam="bar"
              anotherSuperLongParam="baz" >
              <Quux />
            </Foo>



Props and State

They should both be written in camelCase
Add the component PropTypes after the class is declared
This is good as a reference point
It also gives indications if things break
RegistrationAddressBilling.propTypes = {
    previousStep: React.PropTypes.func.isRequired,
    nextStep: React.PropTypes.func.isRequired,
    saveValues: React.PropTypes.func.isRequired,
    fieldValues: React.PropTypes.object
}



Methods

Component Methods should be ordered in the following way
optional static methods
constructor
getChildContext
componentWillMount
componentDidMount
componentWillReceiveProps
shouldComponentUpdate
componentWillUpdate
componentDidUpdate
componentWillUnmount
clickHandlers or eventHandlers like onClickSubmit() or onChangeDescription()
getter methods for render like getSelectReason() or getFooterContent()
Optional render methods like renderNavigation() or renderProfilePicture()
