Polyminoes.jl
My own attempt in writing a Polyminoes solver.
For now the objective is: given a set of pieces, find a way in which they all fit in a given space.
There are the 7 classical pieces from tetris implemented and an NxM board.
Usage example: Fit a stick, L, J and Z in a 4x4 square

For now the code works for small shapes, like 4x4 and 4x5, more than that... good luck :)
