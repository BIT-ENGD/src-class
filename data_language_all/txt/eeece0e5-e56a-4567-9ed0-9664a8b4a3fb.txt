Build bitcore zcashd by yourself
Assuming you have debian-based distro.

sudo apt-get install git build-essential pkg-config libc6-dev m4 g++-multilib autoconf libtool ncurses-dev unzip git python zlib1g-dev wget bsdmainutils automake
git clone 'https://github.com/str4d/zcash.git'
cd zcash && git checkout v1.0.0-bitcore-3 - this is important only for bitcore address index patches
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc) - and wait an hour or two

Voila, zcasd is in ./src.
Running zcashd
You have to download parameters first.

./fetch_params

Two large files, 1GB total, will be downloaded sloooowly into ~/.zcash-params/ (from amazon aws).
Now you can run ./zcashd from src.
Also see the official guide - note that it does not install bitcore addressindex patches!
