The Ionosphere
Note that the TEC of the
model ionosphere is currently hard coded to zero inside TTCal.
Refraction
The index of refraction of a cold, collisionless, and unmagnetized plasma is
[
    n = \sqrt{1 - \frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2}},
]
where $\omega_p$ is the
plasma frequency
and $\omega = 2\pi\nu$ is the angular frequency of the incident radiation.
TTCal models the ionosphere as a single uniform spherical shell. That is it does not
account for the fact that ionosphere has multiple layers or that the density can
vary within a layer. However with this simplification the refraction off the inner and
outer edges of the ionosphere can be calculated with a simple ray tracer (see the
diagram below).

Absorption
Ionospheric absorption is not currently accounted for.
