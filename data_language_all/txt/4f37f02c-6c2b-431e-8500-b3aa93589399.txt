Increment Xcode Build Number
A Swift script that will increase the build number of all your Xcode projects. This only works for standalone Xcode projects, if your project is inside a workspace, this script will not do anything.
The script is written in Swift 3.0.2
Instructions

Put the script where you want it on your Mac. I put mine in my ~/Developer folder.
Compile the script in the terminal using swiftc like this: swiftc increment_build_number.swift
Add the binary to the Xcode Build Succeded Behavior in the Xcode Preferences (see screenshot below)
