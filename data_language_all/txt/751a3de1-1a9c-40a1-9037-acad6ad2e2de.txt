DEPRECATION NOTICE
This module is deprecated. Use lua-ext instead.

String-Ext SubModule
This module adds some utility functions to the string namespace
Installation
This script is not standalone and must be used with your own script, as it doesn't have a definition.xml file.
Direct installation (not recommended)
You only need to copy the file string-ext.lua to your script's directory. Whenever the file needs updating, this manual step must be done. This is a non-desirable method as, if commited, it will create duplicate versions of this file across different repositories.
Using as a Git Sub-Module (recommended)
At the script base folder, execute the two commands
$ git submodule add https://github.com/RisingWorld/string-ext
$ git commit -am 'Added string-ext sub-module'
This will create a directory called string-ext, and clone this repository in it. However, the content of the directory will not be commited with the rest of your project, only the directory entry and a file called .gitmodules 
Whenever the project needs updating, perform this command, also at the script's base folder :
$ git submodule update --remote string-ext
Refer to the official Git documentation for more information.
Usage
Just include the script string-ext.lua. The file should not be included twice. Once included, the extended features will be available globally.
