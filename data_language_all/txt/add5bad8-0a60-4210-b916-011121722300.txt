The following parameters must be set:
* BIN_PATH:     paths to pre-requisite binaries

* H_STACK:          stack space for binary execution

Make the sample info file
The sample info file has 3 space-separated columns

MOSAIC1   ProbBProbA10    /testDir/variants/variants.phased.vcf.gz
* Column 1: Sample type.  Can be MAJOR, MINOR or MOSAIC. 1 major and 1 minor sample need to be specified and at least 1 mosaic sample is required. Mosaic sample names need to be prefixed with 'MOSAIC'.
