Digits iteration for unsigned integer types.
The IntoDigits trait offers a number of methods to facilitate dealing with 
unsigned integers as digits.
For less simple uses, the DigitsIterator implements a number of methods to 
manipulate the number in place, offering more control than the IntoDigits 
trait. 
Features
This crate can be used without the standard library.
The DigitsIterator struct as well as the IntoDigits trait are only 
implemented for primitive unsigned types: u8, u16, u32, u64, u128,
usize as well as their corresponding Wrapping types.
Internal numerical operations use wrapping semantics when required, both for 
the sake of simplicity and performance. It is expected that checked 
operations will be used in a future version, while tying wrapping operations 
to an optional feature for performance sensitive uses.
