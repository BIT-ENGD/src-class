is-image

Check if a filepath is an image

The package is very similar to image-type but it does not depend on built in path and does not use const or Set. It makes it simpler to use it in older browsers without a transpilation step. It does not handle all of the edge cases as path.extname does though.
Install
$ npm install @buxlabs/is-image
