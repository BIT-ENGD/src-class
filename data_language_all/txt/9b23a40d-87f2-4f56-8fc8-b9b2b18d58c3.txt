Getting Started
The first step to creating IoT devices using Stratify OS is to install the command line tool (called sl). You can do so in just a few seconds by copying and pasting the commands below to a bash terminal.
Install sl on Mac
mkdir -p /Applications/StratifyLabs-SDK/Tools/gcc/bin
curl -L -o /Applications/StratifyLabs-SDK/Tools/gcc/bin/sl 'https://stratifylabs.page.link/slmac'
chmod 755 /Applications/StratifyLabs-SDK/Tools/gcc/bin/sl
echo 'export PATH=/Applications/StratifyLabs-SDK/Tools/gcc/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
Install sl on Windows
First, install GitBash (or another MinGW terminal) with access to curl.
mkdir -p /C/StratifyLabs-SDK/Tools/gcc/bin
curl -L -o /C/StratifyLabs-SDK/Tools/gcc/bin/sl.exe 'https://stratifylabs.page.link/slwin'
chmod 755 /C/StratifyLabs-SDK/Tools/gcc/bin/sl.exe
echo 'export PATH=/C/StratifyLabs-SDK/Tools/gcc/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
Verify Installation
Verify the command line tool installed by typing sl --version. The first time you type the command, the browser will be launched so that you can login. You copy the login command to the terminal and execute it. Then type sl --version again. The output should look something like this.

From there, you can check out the tutorials within the Stratify Dashboard. Here are a few quick examples:
Install Stratify OS on a supported board
sl cloud.bootstrap:bootloader
sl cloud.bootstrap:os
Install and Run HelloWorld from the Stratify Cloud
sl cloud.install:id=Kvp7xXzdO94kyCWAAcmW application.run:path=HelloWorld,terminal
Install the SDK then Build and Run HelloWorld
sl sdk.install
sl app.create:name=HelloWorld
sl app.build:path=HelloWorld app.install:path=HelloWorld,run,terminal

The sl command line tool is used to manage Stratify OS applications, data, and OS packages. To read about its capabilites, see the manual.
API Reference
Stratify OS applications can be built using the StratifyAPI library which is an embedded friendly C++ library for many POSIX and standard C library functions. Or they can be built using direct calls to POSIX and standard C library functions.
