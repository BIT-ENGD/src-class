Usage
Create your <select> with the .selectpicker class.

Enable Bootstrap-Select via JavaScript:
js
$('.selectpicker').selectpicker();
Or just
js
$('select').selectpicker();
Starting with the current dev version, we support bootstrap's data-api, which means that you don't even have to manually instanciate bootstrap-select.
Checkout the documentation for further information.
