Original magic instruction profiling. Execution of one thousand empty magic instructions, each being profiled.
profile.dat
Profiling of the profiling method used to time from within Target machine. Simply writing start and stop, respectively, to the serial console - without doing anythin in-between. Performed in a similar fashion to paramagic.ms, without the magic instruction. As such, paraprofile.ms contains measurements of the overhead one may expect using this method.
magicinstrprofileall.dat
Better measurements of time overhead whilst using magic instructions. Profiles the execution of 1000 magic instructions.
The above is performed 1000 times to collect avg data.
