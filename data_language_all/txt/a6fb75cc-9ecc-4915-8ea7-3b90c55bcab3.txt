
Introduction
SlicerSALT is an open-source, free comprehensive software that will allow biomedical scientists to precisely locate shape changes in their imaging studies. This software called Slicer Shape AnaLysis Toolbox (SlicerSALT), will enhance the intuitiveness and ease of use for such studies, as well as allow researchers to find shape changes with higher statistical power. Altogether this constitutes a crucial resource for the imaging field that will enable many and important new findings in biomedical imaging studies.

Register Github Access to create an account
Create SSH keys associated to your account: SSH Key Generation Instructions.
Recommended: keep the passphrase empty for your SSH key to let the Superbuild work without interruptions


Add the SSH key to your Github account: Steps to add SSH Key to Github.
Clone the repository and follow platform specific instructions below:$ git clone git://github.com/Kitware/slicerSALT.git



Build
Make sure that you can compile Slicer OR have the Prerequisites for Slicer: Slicer Build Instructions.
Windows
Tested Development environment: Slicer Windows Dev Environment.

Run CMake (cmake-gui) from the Windows Start Menu
Set the build directory C:\slicerSALT-Debug or C:\slicerSALT-Release
Select your compiler: Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64
If using a newer version of Visual Studio, be sure to specify the 2015 toolset (v140)
Configure using default options. You may get a configuration error that QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE is not set, which is normal.
Verify that QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE is set to the QT version that was used to compile Slicer
Click generate the close cmake-gui


Build (be prepared to wait for some hours!)
Open the top-level slicerSALT.sln in the build directory
If you're trying to build Release mode, make sure to set the active configuration to Release 
Build Solution!


slicerSALT executable lives in path/to/slicerSALT-build/S-bld/Slicer-build/

Unix-like
MacOSX Note: Beginning XCode 7 support for OpenMP has been removed. So if you're using XCode 7 or above OpenMP will be bypassed during build process.
    $ mkdir slicerSALT-build
    $ cd slicerSALT-build


Configure CMake
$ ccmake ../slicerSALT
Point CMake to the QT version that was used to compile Slicer
MacOSX: Set variable CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET to 10.9 (Mavericks) / 10.10 (Yosemite) / 10.11 (El Capitan)


Build (be prepared to wait for some hours!)$ make -j4
