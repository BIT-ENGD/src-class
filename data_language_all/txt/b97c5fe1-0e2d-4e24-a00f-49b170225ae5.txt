Contributing to DataDepsGenerators.jl
To emphasise this at the start:
if you have an open PR or Issue, feel free to bump it, or ask for a status update
every few days if you've not gotten a response yet,
or even if it has been been a while.
There is a good chance I have lost track of your issue/PR in the GitHub notifications screen;
and a reminder would be appreciated.
Don't worry that you might annoy me, I will let you know if you are;
or more likely I will tell you when it is a good time to bump me again (e.g. next week).
Issues / Bug reports
Issues should be raised on this GitHub at:
https://github.com/oxinabox/DataDepsGenerators.jl/issues
It is worth knowing that some bugs will need help from the data repositories support team.
I can advise on that; often I'll want to take it up with them.
Questions
If you have any questions about DataDepsGenerators.jl,
feel encouraged to ping @oxinabox on the JuliaLang Slack in the #data channel,
or on the JuliaLang Discourse forum again in the data channel.
It is also permissible to ask questions by opening issues on this GitHub Repo.
Ideally, such questions be phrased as requests for documentation.
If your question is not answered by the docs(/readme), then it is a sign the docs could be improved.
Contributing Code
Code contributions are welcome and encouraged.
Especially adding support for a new data repository.
Code contributions should be made in the normal way of making a pull request.
In general they should try to match the style of the code already present.
This follows the julialang/julia repo conventions.
