 Answers 

Server-side could be considered the old, typical version of routing. Now we have client-side, which can be done without a page refresh (which server-side requires)!
HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol.
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete.
Create: post, Read: get, Update: put, Delete: delete
We can use the fetch API, the axios library, the jQuery library, and so on.
