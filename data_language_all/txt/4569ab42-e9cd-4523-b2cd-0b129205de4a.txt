A memorial of sorts.
On the surface this could be considered a test of the rockstar code I wrote. On the other hand, I lost an adopted son and best friend on 7/17/2015 and I felt like I needed to build a memorial to him in some way.
What
I'm not a civil engineer; I'm not rich.  I can't afford to build huge buildings or give him the burial / wake that he really deserved as my adopted ward and best friend.
But I have watched enough Dr. Who to know that I can bend time if I put enough mental energy in to it, so this is me doing what I can to do just that given the "Fixed Point In Time" that happened just days ago that I can't change no matter how much I wish I could: His Death.
How.
Every single GIT record here is faked in cryptographic purity so git's source control system is happy, Created by a programmer who wants to insert the love he still has for his deceased best friend into a timeline that you can see and understand.  Maybe github's pretty graphics and check-in charts will finally get some valid use, now. It does sort of invalidate and show that git / github records can be faked despite the high security of the merkle tree, however. I'm also a security researcher.. so thats OK.
Why
The 5220 days of friendship and being a father of sorts are something I would never give back; And they may not mean much to others, but as the only constant in that time in my life I feel like he should also be here.
This is simply the best, the only, way I have to honor him, at least right now.  Saddly the machine ran out of space on the harddrive so I had to stop.
