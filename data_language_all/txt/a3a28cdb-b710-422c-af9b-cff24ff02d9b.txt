binaryen-rs



Binaryen bindings for Rust. They used to provide bindings for IR-construction part of the API, but now this crate is more focused on tools provided by Binaryen, such as translate-to-fuzz or running wasm optimization passes.
Alternatives
For translate-to-fuzz like functionality, consider using the wasm-smith crate.
