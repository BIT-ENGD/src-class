mariagwyn does dotfiles
Based on Zach Holman's' excellent
dotfiles repo, modified for bash rather than ZSH, simplified, and tailored for me.
Topical
Everything's built around topic areas. If you're adding a new area to your
forked dotfiles — say, "Drupal" — you can simply add a drupal directory and put
files in there. Anything with an extension of .sh will get automatically
included into your shell (exceptions below under Components). Anything with an extension of .symlink will get symlinked without extension into $HOME when you run script/bootstrap.
Components
There's a few special files in the hierarchy.

bin/: Anything in bin/ will get added to your $PATH and be made
  available everywhere.
Brewfile: This is a list of applications for Homebrew Cask to install: things like Chrome and 1Password and Adium and stuff. Might want to edit this file before running any initial setup.
topic/*.sh: Any files ending in .sh get loaded into your
  environment.
topic/path.sh: Any file named path.sh is loaded first and is
  expected to setup $PATH or similar.
topic/completion.sh: Any file named completion.sh is loaded
  last and is expected to setup autocomplete.
topic/*.symlink: Any files ending in *.symlink get symlinked into
  your $HOME. This is so you can keep all of those versioned in your dotfiles
  but still keep those autoloaded files in your home directory. These get
  symlinked in when you run script/bootstrap.

Install
Run this:
sh
git clone git@github.com:mariagwyn/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/bootstrap
This will symlink the appropriate files in .dotfiles to your home directory.
Everything is configured and tweaked within ~/.dotfiles.
The main file you'll want to change right off the bat is bash/bash_profile.symlink,
which sets up a few paths that'll be different on your particular machine.
Update
dot is a simple script that installs some dependencies, sets sane macOS
defaults, and so on. Tweak this script, and occasionally run dot from
time to time to keep your environment fresh and up-to-date. You can find
this script in bin/.
