1.3.0

Expose a top-level context field that provides access to a Context object
  for the current system.

1.2.3

Don't cache path Context based on cwd, as cwd involves a system-call to
  compute.

1.2.2

Remove the documentation link from the pubspec so this is linked to
  pub.dartlang.org by default.

1.2.1


Many members on Style that provided access to patterns and functions used
  internally for parsing paths have been deprecated.


Manually parse paths (rather than using RegExps to do so) for better
  performance.


1.2.0

Added path.prettyUri, which produces a human-readable representation of a
  URI.

1.1.0

path.fromUri now accepts strings as well as Uri objects.
