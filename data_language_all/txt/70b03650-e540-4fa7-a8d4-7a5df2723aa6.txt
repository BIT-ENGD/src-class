README FOR RPATH ISSUES ON MAC
On newer versions of the Mac OS X operating system, there is a feature called "System Integrity Protection" which forbids dynamic loading from relative paths. In order to address this and yet allow you to move our libraries to a different path on your filesystem, we have provided a script that changes the LC_RPATH entries inside our libraries to the path at which the libraries are located. The script only works once after you download fresh libraries, so you will have to download unchanged libraries and run the script on them again whenever you want to move them to a different directory.
I am unable to run the samples
If you get one of these error messages, or similar: 
dyld: warning, LC_RPATH . in /Users/Username/PDFNetWrappersMac/PDFNetC/Lib/PDFNetRuby.bundle being ignored in restricted program because it is a relative path
dyld: warning, LC_RPATH . in /Users/Username/PDFNetWrappersMac/PDFNetC/Lib/_PDFNetPython.so being ignored in restricted program because it is a relative path
Then, the most likely problem is that your Mac OS X operating system has System Integrity Protection enabled, and the LC_RPATH of the PDFNet wrapper files need to be updated.
Resolution
cd ./PDFNetC/Lib
./fix_rpaths.sh
I am trying to integrate PDFNet into my project
If you get an error message similar to the ones above in your own project, the do the following whenever you intend to move the library files to a different filesystem path:

Download PDFNetC SDK again, or just extract again, so that you have fresh PDFNetC libraries.
Copy fix_rpaths.sh and the libraries you need (i.e. libPDFNetC.dylib and one or both of _PDFNetPython.so, PDFNetRuby.bundle) from <package path>/PDFNetC/Lib to the destination directory in your project.
Run ./fix_rpaths.sh with the working directory set to the destination directory from step (2) above.
