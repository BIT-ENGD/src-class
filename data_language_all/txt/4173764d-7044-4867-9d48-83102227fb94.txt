SR(A)WN 2016 — 6
This is the sixth issue of the 2016 Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter, a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings‐on across Student Robotics. Emboldened items are ones which we believe could do with extra hands. An absence of emboldening does not necessarily mean that everything is done.


James Thompson has won the position of Public Interaction on the steering committee.
