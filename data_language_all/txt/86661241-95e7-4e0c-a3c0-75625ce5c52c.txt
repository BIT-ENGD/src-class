Description
This layer adds experimental support for C# language using OmniSharp.
Packages Included

OmniSharp-emacs
OmniSharp-server

Install
To use this contribution add it to your ~/.spacemacs
elisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(csharp))
Prerequisites
ASP.NET 5
Follow the instructions for your platform here.
curl
You'll need curl to be able to use the Omnisharp package. Use your favorite
package manager to install it (on Windows you can use chocolatey).
Be sure to make the curl binary available to your PATH environment variable,
or set the variable omnisharp--curl-executable-path in your dotfile function
dotspacemacs-config:
elisp
(setq-default omnisharp--curl-executable-path "/PATH/TO/CURL/curl")
Omnisharp server
You have to compile the OmniSharp server following the instructions which can
be found here.
Don't forget to add the server binary directory to your system PATH environment
variable. The full path the binary can also be directly referenced in the
variable omnisharp-server-executable-path (put this in your
dotspacemacs-config function):
elisp
(setq-default omnisharp-server-executable-path "/PATH/TO/OMNISHARP/OmniSharpServer")
OmniSharp should now automatically load and start a server when you open a
.cs file.
Caveats


It's currently not possible to create a C# solution outside of an IDE such as
MonoDevelop, it's therefore recommended that you install it to create your
solutions.


Debugging is possible using SDB.
