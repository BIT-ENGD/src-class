TODO


Port to Mac OS X (should be quite easy, you just have to make sure the right binary dependencies are installed using BinDeps)


Implement a Julia layer similar to Caffe's Python layer


Wrap Caffe's SGD implementation and using that make it possible to train AlexNet on ImageNet; this would also guarantee that all the caffe models can be trained with exactly the same parameters as in the Caffe model zoo.


Integrate Caffe's multi GPU support


Port over more Caffe models and wrap all the remaining layers
