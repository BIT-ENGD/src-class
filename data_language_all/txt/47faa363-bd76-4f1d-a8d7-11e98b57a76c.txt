cookie-parser




Parse Cookie header and populate req.cookies with an object keyed by the cookie
names. Optionally you may enable signed cookie support by passing a secret string,
which assigns req.secret so it may be used by other middleware.
Installation
sh
$ npm install cookie-parser
API

cookieParser(secret, options)

secret a string used for signing cookies. This is optional and if not specified, will not parse signed cookies.
options an object that is passed to cookie.parse as the second option. See cookie for more information.
decode a function to decode the value of the cookie

cookieParser.JSONCookie(str)
Parse a cookie value as a JSON cookie. This will return the parsed JSON value if it was a JSON cookie, otherwise it will return the passed value.
cookieParser.JSONCookies(cookies)
Given an object, this will iterate over the keys and call JSONCookie on each value. This will return the same object passed in.
cookieParser.signedCookie(str, secret)
Parse a cookie value as a signed cookie. This will return the parsed unsigned value if it was a signed cookie and the signature was valid, otherwise it will return the passed value.
cookieParser.signedCookies(cookies, secret)
Given an object, this will iterate over the keys and check if any value is a signed cookie. If it is a signed cookie and the signature is valid, the key will be deleted from the object and added to the new object that is returned.
