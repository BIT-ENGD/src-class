4) You can configure this date picker at application level in the config method using the ionicDatePicker provider.
Your config method may look like this if you wish to setup the configuration. But this is not mandatory step.
javascript
.config(function (ionicDatePickerProvider) {
    var datePickerObj = {
      inputDate: new Date(),
      setLabel: 'Set',
      todayLabel: 'Today',
      closeLabel: 'Close',
      mondayFirst: false,
      weeksList: ["S", "M", "T", "W", "T", "F", "S"],
      monthsList: ["Jan", "Feb", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "Aug", "Sept", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"],
      templateType: 'popup',
      from: new Date(2012, 8, 1),
      to: new Date(2018, 8, 1),
      showTodayButton: true,
      dateFormat: 'dd MMMM yyyy',
      closeOnSelect: false,
      disableWeekdays: []
    };
    ionicDatePickerProvider.configDatePicker(datePickerObj);
  })
In the above code i am not configuring all the properties, but you can configure as many properties as you can.

f) weeksList(Optional) : This is an array with a list of all week days. You can use this if you want to show months in some other language or format or if you wish to use the modal instead of the popup for this component, you can define the weekDaysList array in your controller as shown below.
javascript
  ["Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "thu", "Fri", "Sat"];
 The default values are
javascript
  ["S", "M", "T", "W", "T", "F", "S"];
g) monthsList(Optional) : This is an array with a list of all months. You can use this if you want to show months in some other language or format. You can create an array like below.

h) disabledDates(Optional) : If you have a list of dates to disable, you can create an array like below. Default value is an empty array.
javascript
  var disabledDates = [
      new Date(1437719836326),
      new Date(),
      new Date(2016, 7, 10), //Months are 0-based, this is August, 10th.
      new Date('Wednesday, August 12, 2015'), //Works with any valid Date formats like long format
      new Date("08-14-2016"), //Short format
      new Date(1439676000000) //UNIX format
  ];
i) templateType(Optional) : This is string type which takes two values i.e. modal or popup. Default value is modal. If you wish to open in a popup, you can specify the value as popup or else you can ignore it.
j) from(Optional) : This is a date object, from which you wish to enable the dates. You can use this property to disable previous dates by specifying from: new Date(). By default all the dates are enabled. Please note that months are 0 based.
k) to(Optional) : This is a date object, to which you wish to enable the dates. You can use this property to disable future dates by specifying to: new Date(). By default all the dates are enabled. Please note that months are 0 based.
l) dateFormat(Optional) : This is date format used in template. Defaults to dd-MM-yyyy. For how to format date, see: http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.9.1.15
m) showTodayButton(Optional) : Boolean to specify whether to show the Today button or not. The default values is false.
n) closeOnSelect(Optional) : Boolean to indicate whether date picker popup/modal will be closed after selection. If set to true, Set button will be hidden. The default value is false.
o) disableWeekdays(Optional) : Accepts array of numbers starting from 0(Sunday) to 6(Saturday). If you specify any values for this array, then it will disable that week day in the whole calendar. For example if you pass [0,6], then all the Sundays and Saturdays will be disabled.
5) Inject ionicDatePicker in the controller, where you wish to use this component. Then using the below method you can call the datepicker.
``
Apart from the config method, you can re configure all options in the controller also. If you again set any of the properties, they will be overridden by the values mentioned in the controller. This will be useful if there are multiple date pickers in the app, which has different properties.
In all the above steps the only mandatory thing is the callback where you will get the selected date value.
