alert: Notify your desktop or mobile device when a job completes
WORK IN PROGRESS. This is under heavy development the week of 8 May 2017.
At Faraday, we have a lot of long-running processes, and we need an easy way to
know when they complete. The alert command is intended to make it easy to know
when things succeed or fail:

This will play different sounds for success and failure.
Right now, we support Superblock, LLC's Pushover system, which provides
excellent, hard-to-miss notifications for iOS, Android and web browsers.
(This application has no relation to Superblock, LLC. We just use their
API.)
We also have support for desktop notifiations and the open
source Notify app, but the CLI for configurating them isn't finished
yet. To use desktop notifications, try:
sh
export ALERT_NOTIFIER=desktop
Wish list
Some features which we want to add:

A command-line interface for configuring notification backends easily.
Terminal support for alert watch.
Maybe some sort of mode for watching to see when a host has finished booting?

Installing
On Linux, you'll need to install the dbus-1 dev packages.

Once this is done, install Rust and alert:
sh
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
cargo install alert
