Latest Releases

4.2.1
Fixed autocompletes of completions that contain spaces
Depricated isCaseSensitive in favor of a function asignment to pre-process autocompletions


4.2.0
Added new API for overriding the main middle view, normally the InputTextView so it can be replaced with views such as a "Join" button", setMiddleContentView(_ view: UIView?, animated: Bool)


4.1.2
        - Add RxSwift/RxCocoa support through extensions and delegate proxies in RxInputBarAccessoryView, requires RxSwift and RxCocoa
        - Add InputBarViewController which contains an InputBarAccessoryView as the inputAccessoryView by default with a convenient isInputBarHidden: Bool property to show/hide it 
4.1.1
        - Add frameInsets: HorizontalEdgePadding property to InputBarAccessoryView to inset the view to be compatible with UISplitViewController or other custom containers where the view should not be the full width
4.1.0
        - Fix issue where setting long strings in viewDidLoad broke inital layout, Issue #41
        - Add deleteCompletionByParts: Bool flag to AutocompleteManager to allow for partial deletions of autocompletes rather than just the entire substring. 
        - Add InputBarSendButton to use as the sendButton in InputBarAccessoryView. This subclass of InputBarButtonItem has a UIActivityIndicatorView to show a spinner when making HTTP requests

Layout
The layout of the InputBarAccessoryView is made of of 4  InputStackView's and an InputTextView. The padding of the subviews can be easily adjusted by changing the padding and textViewPadding properties. The constraints will automatically be updated.

It is important to note that each of the InputStackView's to the left and right of the InputTextView are anchored by a width constraint. This way the InputTextView will always fill the space inbetween in addition to providing methods that can easily be called to hide all buttons to the right or left of the InputTextView by setting the width constraint constant to 0. The bottom and top stack views are not height constraint and rely on their intrinsicContentSize

Reactive Hooks
Each InputBarButtonItem has properties that can hold actions that will be executed during various hooks such as the button being touched, the UITextViewtext changing and more! Thanks to these easy hooks with a few lines of code the items can be easily resized and animated similar to that of the Facebook messenger app.
