gh-deploy 

A one-liner to kick-start static pages, using GitHub Pages

This module will:

Create a new repo, following GitHub Pages convention
Add a stub index.html
Clone the repo into the current folder
Open the GitHub page in the browser, once the page is ready

As a result you will:

Have a deployed HTML page on GitHub
Have a cloned Git repository, ready to make further changes

Installation
npm install -g gh-deploy
Demo
Part I - Hello World (19 seconds) (a little outdated - there are no input arguments anymore - the wizard asks about them)
Part II - Deploy Todo MVC (36 seconds)
Usage
gh-deploy
The wizard asks about the following items:

GitHub username
GitHub password
Page name - name of the github repository. This defines the page URL

Page URL
GitHub offers two options for page URLs:

http://username.github.io - use username.github.io as the reponame
http://username.github.io/reponame - use any other reponame
