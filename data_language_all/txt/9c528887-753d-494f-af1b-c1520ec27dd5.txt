Missionary-Cannibals-Problem
Classical missionary cannibal problem in LISP. 
The solution uses a greedy search strategy to solve the given problem. Greedy algorithm works through a problem on the basis of heuristic (h) and tries to obtain global optimum by making optimal choices locally.
The solution uses an admissible heuristic, which is (total number of missionaries + total number of cannibals -1 on the starting side of the river). States are stored in a data structure state-node
state-node{
    state - an array containing number of missionary, cannibals and boat position
    h - heuristic
    state_id – a unique number given to this state for identification 
    parent_state_id – state id of the parent state
}
