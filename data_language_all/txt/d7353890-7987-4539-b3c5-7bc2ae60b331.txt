rcat
rcat is a (very) minimalistic implementation of the Unix cat utility in Rust. It probably sucks too.
Purpose
I have written this program just to get started with Rust. It should not be used for anything serious.
Build and Usage
Provided that Rust is already installed:
cargo run --verbose -- test.txt
