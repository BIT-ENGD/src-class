AURCHPACK
This Makefile uses a list of
AUR packages to
automatically batch install those packages. You need to have make installed,
of course.
NOTE: It is best to first make download and then check the PKGBUILDs
for security reasons!
Features

Install base-devel via pacman
Downloading all PKGBUILDs from AUR listed in the specific file
Build and install all those packages via makepkg
Download only once!

Usage


Create file pkgfile with AUR packages. Only valid names and no blank lines
  allowed!
package_name1
package_name2


make checks for base-devel package, downloads and extracts PKGBUILDs,
  installs packages

make download checks for base-devel package, downloads and extracts
  PKGBUILDs, but does not install them
make deps only installs base-devel package
make clean cleans all files

Environment Variables
You can pass environment variables to make like make VARIABLE=value
[target], e. g. make DOWNLOAD=false install.

PKGFILE=pkgfile: File with list
DLDIR=/tmp/aurchpack: Download and build there
INSTALL=true: Install packages
DOWNLOAD=true: Download packages
DEPS=true: install base-devel package
MAKEPKG=-si: makepkg parameters

License
Do with it what you want.
Trivia

The file downloaded tells aurchpack that it does not need to download
  the files again. This way you can call make download and make install
  separately without downloading all packages again.
inferno is actually the Inferno Operating
  System
sc-im is a terminal spreadsheet
  calculator

Why?
This may be the simplest way to install AUR packages. I want to use it as a
tool to sync my arch setup to another pc.
