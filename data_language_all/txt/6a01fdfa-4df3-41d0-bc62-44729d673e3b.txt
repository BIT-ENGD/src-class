About Me
My name is Jed Davis, and I poke at computers.  I seem to wind up
doing low-level / systems programming for a living — currently for
Mozilla — and I've also been a system administrator, but after a
run-in with grad school I also know more programming language theory
than may be entirely healthy.
(This space reserved for future expansion by describing the
non-computer-poking things I spend time on.)
