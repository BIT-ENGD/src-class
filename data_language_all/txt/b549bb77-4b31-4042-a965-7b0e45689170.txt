Planning and Development Stage:
Initially planned out the wireframe for the site and listed the user stories to showcase what functions I wanted to include in the over site. Afterwards added HTML elements to create the gameboard and added CSS to put borders around the boxes.
Afterwards implimented the API to ensure the requests were working. API was important to impliment as soon as possible so that way you can ensure the request would encounter no problems. I added the events, js and api to my scripts folder soon after to give me visual responses as I worked on the game.
Next step in the planning was come up with the game logic, I wanted my game to switch the user from X to O and vice versa after every click, make sure the winning conditions were correct and no allow the user to click on a square that was already filled or when the game was over.
After all the logic and APIs were working correctly, had to ensure the game had a CSS that was stylish and responsive, I implimented bootstrap and SASS so everything worked together.
Unsolved Problems/Future Plans:
Main concern for future plans will be to style it and make it more mobile friendly. I would like to add multiplayer to the game and have users play with others over the internet. Also down the line I want to impliment AI so users can play against a computer with different difficulty levels.
