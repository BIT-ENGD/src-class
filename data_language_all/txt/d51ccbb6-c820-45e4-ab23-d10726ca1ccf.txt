YANG Parser
This is a parser for the YANG data modelling language (RFC 7950). It is written in CoffeeScript using the Comparse functional parsing library.
So far, the parser only does lexical analysis using the rules of RFC 7950. That is, the parse function returns an object representing the tree of YANG statements without doing any syntactic or semantic checks.
The annotated CoffeeScript source is here.
