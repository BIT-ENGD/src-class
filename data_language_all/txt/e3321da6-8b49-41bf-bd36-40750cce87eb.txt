Elastic dictionaries for Bokmål/Nynorsk. 
This repository contains stopword and synonym dictionaries for Norwegian, aimed to be used with Elastic.
Both dictionaries are using the dictionary format assumed by Elastic:
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/master/using-stopwords.html
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/master/synonyms-expand-or-contract.html
The synonym dictionaries should typically be used if we have an elastic index which contains document in
both Bokmål and Nynorsk. Without some kind of normalization, the query results from the index will be very
biased by the language of the query. E.g. a query for "fremtiden" will typically not be able to find other Nynorsk documents where
the word "framtida" has been used instead. The synonym dictionary will either expand a number of synonyms for
each word in the document, or reduce words of similar meaning to one canonical form, either in Nynorsk or 
Bokmål.
