Notes
A simple script that creates commit messages from lists
of todos. It also has support for saving your todos in
a dropbox folder.
When I have to operate under a strict deadline I tend to break down
everything into todos and then complete and commit them. This is a nifty little
script that automates creation of commit messages from those todos.
Installation
The script is written in bash, so you'll need a terminal
running bash. To install, clone this repo somewhere and add
the path to it in the PATH variable.
Usage
Run notes init to setup the notes folder for the current project.
The notes  folder will be created in ~/Dropbox/work/notes location if
you have Dropbox desktop client installed on your system otherwise the
location is ~/notes. The notes directory for the project is then symlinked
into the project directory so that you can edit your todos from your editor.
I use Plain Tasks plugin in Sublime Text. Now tick off your todos stage your
changes and run notes commit.
