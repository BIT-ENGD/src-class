Ionic App Base
A starting project for Ionic that optionally supports using custom SCSS.
Using this project
We recommend using the Ionic CLI to create new Ionic projects that are based on this project but use a ready-made starter template.
For example, to start a new Ionic project with the default tabs interface, make sure the ionic utility is installed:
bash
$ npm install -g ionic
Then run:
bash
$ ionic start myProject tabs
More info on this can be found on the Ionic Getting Started page and the Ionic CLI repo.
