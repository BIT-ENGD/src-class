What is it ?
Just a POC for the fun of a rust code (with my lib fraw) into asmjs, working with ionic4 components in cordova. 
How to build ?

Install and configure Fraw and wasm for rust
Install cordova
Install dependencies cd cordova && npm install && cd ..
Run script (Unix) ./build.sh <platform> (where <platform> is ios or android)
