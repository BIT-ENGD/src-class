Distributable wrapper for Z3 java api
Attempt at improving portability of the z3 java api. This
project is heavily inspired by previous work in
ScalaZ3.
Building Z3jar
Depends on Java and SBT 0.13.x.


Start by cloning the Z3 source repository
into z3/ (this will be the default location if cloning from repository base).


In order to build z3 and package all relevant sources into a single jar,
simply call sbt package. The resulting jar (for scala 2.11) can be found at
target/scala-2.11/z3jar_2.11-1.0.jar
