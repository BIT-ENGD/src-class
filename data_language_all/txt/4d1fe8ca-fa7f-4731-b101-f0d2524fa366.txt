Installing FFmpeg:


Type ./configure to create the configuration. A list of configure
options is printed by running configure --help.
configure can be launched from a directory different from the FFmpeg
sources to build the objects out of tree. To do this, use an absolute
path when launching configure, e.g. /ffmpegdir/ffmpeg/configure.


Then type make to build FFmpeg. GNU Make 3.81 or later is required.


Type make install to install all binaries and libraries you built.


NOTICE

Non system dependencies (e.g. libx264, libvpx) are disabled by default.
