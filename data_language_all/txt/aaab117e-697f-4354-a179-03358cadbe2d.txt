What is this?
This is a collection of jQuery-powered bookmarklets for the TaoCMS. They assist in many of the day-to-day tasks that can be cumbersome for developers who perform them many times over.
Architecture
Each bookmarklet has its own folder. Some bookmarklets require supporting files.  
Each bookmarklet will have an instructional text file to accompany it called INSTRUCTIONS.txt  
The *.min.js version of the Javascript File has already been compressed for you.
Bookmarklet Folders

_new bookmarklet - blank template for new bookmarklet
select search - Looking for a parent page in a sea of dropdown options? This makes every <SELECT> on the page searchable by text input.
move nav link - Need to move a link in a navigation menu a long ways? This creates a pop up window from which you can reorder links very quickly.
move webform field - Need to move a webform field to the top of the list? This creates a pop up window from which you can reorder fields very quickly.
webpage id - Need the ID of a page in the Webpage module? This displays the id of each webpage in the webpage module page list.
