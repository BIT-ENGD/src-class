vcpkg_from_github
Download and extract a project from GitHub. Enables support for install --head.
Usage:
cmake
vcpkg_from_github(
    OUT_SOURCE_PATH <SOURCE_PATH>
    REPO <Microsoft/cpprestsdk>
    [REF <v2.0.0>]
    [SHA512 <45d0d7f8cc350...>]
    [HEAD_REF <master>]
)
Parameters:
OUT_SOURCE_PATH
Specifies the out-variable that will contain the extracted location.
This should be set to SOURCE_PATH by convention.
REPO
The organization or user and repository on GitHub.
REF
A stable git commit-ish (ideally a tag) that will not change contents. This should not be a branch.
For repositories without official releases, this can be set to the full commit id of the current latest master.
If REF is specified, SHA512 must also be specified.
SHA512
The SHA512 hash that should match the archive (https://github.com/${REPO}/archive/${REF}.tar.gz).
This is most easily determined by first setting it to 1, then trying to build the port. The error message will contain the full hash, which can be copied back into the portfile.
HEAD_REF
The unstable git commit-ish (ideally a branch) to pull for --head builds.
For most projects, this should be master. The chosen branch should be one that is expected to be always buildable on all supported platforms.
Notes:
At least one of REF and HEAD_REF must be specified, however it is preferable for both to be present.
This exports the VCPKG_HEAD_VERSION variable during head builds.
Examples:

cpprestsdk
ms-gsl
beast
