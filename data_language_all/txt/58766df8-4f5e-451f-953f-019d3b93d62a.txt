secret-share-{split,combine}

This tool allows for securely splitting and recombining secrets using a secure
implementation of the Shamir secret sharing scheme. It is a wrapper around my
SSS library.
Usage
You need Rust to build sss-cli from source. When you have installed Rust,
you can install these tools using Cargo:

Note that after this installation, you need to add Cargo's installation
directory to your $PATH if you don't have it there yet.
To uninstall the crate you can use a command similar to the install-command
above.

macOS
To install on macOS system, you can also use Homebrew package
manager. The package is not yet in the upstream homebrew-core, but there exists a tap
with sss-cli formula here.
To install using Homebrew, run: brew install vitkabele/tap/sss-cli.
F.A.Q.
Why are the shares so much longer than the secrets?
This Shamir secret sharing library could produce shares that are shorter than
their current length. However, while Shamir secret sharing is secure for
confidentiality, this is not the case for integrity. An attacker could tamper
with some of the shares. After restoring the (malicious) secret, you would not
be able to know that it has been tampered with. sss-cli uses an AEAD wrapper
so that the shares cannot be tampered with, which takes up some extra space.
