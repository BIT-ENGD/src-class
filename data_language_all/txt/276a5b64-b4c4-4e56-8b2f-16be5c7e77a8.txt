BUGS
I would love to fix the problems folks are having!  Sadly, from the comments so far, I don't have enough information yet. Screenshots or specific text from the crash might help a little. Even better would be the client logs:

Reusing Code and Artwork; Licenses and Whatnot
I'd be pleased to know how far the code and/or artwork is going -- it's fun to see my work get reused! That's why the mod code itself is, as much as possible, GPL 2.x+ and hosted on github.
The necessary media files -- in the "media" branch of the git tree -- are Creative Commons licensed under the CC-BY-SA-4.0 variant.
I am also open to incorporating suggested changes back into the mod. Please consider opening a discussion thread or even a github pull request.
Please follow community and modding etiquette when reposting the mod in forums or on Steam.
