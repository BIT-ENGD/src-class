Installation
You can use DefRS in your own project by adding this project as a Defold library dependency. Open your game.project file and in the dependencies field under project add:
https://github.com/subsoap/defrs/archive/master.zip

Once installed, you can use the resources you wish to use from their associated folders much like you would builtin resources. When you make builds Defold will only package the files you actually use so do not worry about the extra files included. Check your build folder to see for yourself.
Check the source files and examples for full usage.
