CL-PRIORITY-QUEUES
Note: This is not yet released
This is an implementation of CDR-13: Priority Queues for
Common Lisp.  If you need this functionality, you can find most of
it in the excellent library CL-HEAP.  However, CL-HEAP
does not quite conform to the CDR-13 specification and is distributed
under a more restrictive license than this library.
Much of the function documentation here was lifted directly from the
CDR-13 specification.
