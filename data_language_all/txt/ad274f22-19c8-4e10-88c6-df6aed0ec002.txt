Serd.jl

This package provides Julia bindings to Serd,
a C library for serializing RDF data in 
the Turtle, 
TriG,
N-Triples, and
N-Quads formats. The main module Serd
provides a high-level interface for reading and writing RDF, while the submodule
Serd.CSerd is a thin wrapper around Serd's C API.
