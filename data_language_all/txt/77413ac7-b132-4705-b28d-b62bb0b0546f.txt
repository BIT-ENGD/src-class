Usage
Code Examples
Variables used in these examples:
    - hostname:port values are all site specific
    - @path@ is defined by the team that sets up the zUID service
    - @key@ is 1 to 255 character value that represents the key
curl:


Retrieve a value from the zECS instance.
curl -X GET "http://hostname:port@path@@key@"


Put a new key value onto the zECS instance.
curl -X POST "http://hostname:port@path@@key@" (value...)


Delete a key from the instance.
curl -X DELETE "http://hostname:port@path@@key@"


COBOL CICS:

Refer to readme_COBOL_ex1. Shows an insert, retrieve and delete for a key.

Standard browser (Chrome, IE, Safari):


Can only submit GET requests from the browser. Will need other tools like ARC (Advanced REST Client), DCH REST Client, SOAP-UI or Postman to execute additional requests with POST/PUT/DELETE.
Retrieve the value for specified key:
http://hostname:port@path@/@key@


JavaScript:


This small snippet of code will show how to write, read and delete a key/value pair to the zECS instance.

API Reference
Query string parameters:

ttl=99999
   This is only valid with the PUT/POST methods and specifies time to live in seconds for each key. It's a numeric value between 300 (5 minutes) and 86400 (24 hours) seconds. If not specified it defaults to 30 minutes or 1800 seconds. The built-in background expiration process automatically cleans up expired keys. 
clear=*
   This is a request to clear all the keys from the zECS instance and only valid with the DELETE method.

Example URL calls:


GET - http://hostname:port@path@{up_to_255_byte_key}
    No body.


POST - http://hostname:port@path@{up_to_255_byte_key}
    Requires a body containing the data to save under specified key.


PUT - http://hostname:port@path@{up_to_255_byte_key}
    Requires a body containing the data to save under specified key.
