Gulpfile.coffee
Gulpfile for Node.js Express boilerplate with jade, coffeescript, stylus, browserify, browsersync, and other. 
I'am create this repo for learning gulp.js, github and create good boilerplate with my favorite technologies.
You must have already instaled node.js, express, express-generator, nodemon, then:
javascript
 express -c stylus myapp
 cd myapp
 npm i
Will work with gulp#4
javascript
 npm install -g gulpjs/gulp#4.0
 npm install -g coffee-script
 npm install -g stylus
 npm install -g js2coffee
 npm install -g browser-sync
 npm i gulpjs/gulp#4.0 gulp-coffee gulp-util gulp-plumber gulp-stylus gulp-debug gulp-nodemon gulp-js2coffee browser-sync --save-dev
To compile js files to coffee:
javascript 
gulp --require coffee-script/register j2c
or add aliace to bash: 
javascript
alias gulp='gulp --require coffee-script/register' and type
gulp j2c
Now you have coffee files near js files
Do not shure that its right, but i change options "bare" to true in file node_modules/gulp-coffee/index.js to disable wrap function after coffee-script compiling.
To build and start project type:
javasccript
gulp
