Hello World
The classical introductory exercise. Just say "Hello, World!".
"Hello, World!" is
the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language
or environment.
The objectives are simple:

Write a function that returns the string "Hello, World!".
Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.
Submit your solution and check it at the website.

If everything goes well, you will be ready to fetch your first real exercise.
Resources
Remember to check out the Perl 6 documentation and
resources pages for information, tips, and
examples if you get stuck.
Running the tests
There is a test suite and module included with the exercise.
The test suite (a file with the extension .t) will attempt to run routines
from the module (a file with the extension .pm6).
Add/modify routines in the module so that the tests will pass! You can view the
test data by executing the command perl6 --doc *.t (* being the name of the
test suite), and run the test suite for the exercise by executing the command
prove . --exec=perl6 in the exercise directory.
You can also add the -v flag e.g. prove . --exec=perl6 -v to display all
tests, including any optional tests marked as 'TODO'.
