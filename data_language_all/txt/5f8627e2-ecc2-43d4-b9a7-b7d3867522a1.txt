AudioStick: Copy your music playlists to thumb drive.
Description
AudioStick allows you to copy/synchronize .m3u/.m3u8 media playlists to
an arbitrary directory (ex: external thumb drive). After synchronization,
the resultant directory becomes a file-based playlist.
Sample uses
Copy all your music playlists to a single USB stick.  You can then listen to
your favourite music on any media-capable USB port:

Your car's audio console.
Your television's built-in media playback menu.
Your favourite media player.
Your video game console's media playback menu.

Implementation
Although .m3u/.m3u8 playlists are fairly standard among computer media
players, alot of consumer equipment does not yet support these files.
To circumvent this issue, AudioStick creates "filesystem-based playlists":
Each playlist is organized in its own directory, and media files are copied
one-by-one, using numbered prefixes to maintain track order.
Implementation details of file-based playlist:
 - Filenames are prepended with each file's position in the playlist.
 - Each playlist entry/"track" is copied to its own file
   (Adding a "track" twice in a playlist requires 2x the drive space of that
   "track").
Supported playlist files
AudioStick currently supports playlists of the following formats:

M3U playlist (.m3u/.m3u8)

Simply right-click on the desired playlist file, and click on
"Synchronize with AudioStick".
Synchronizing to iTunes playlists
AudioStick synchronizes to iTunes playlists through intermediary .m3u files.
The following steps demonstrate how one can export an iTunes 12 playlist to
the required .m3u format:

In iTunes, open the desired playlist.
Under the File menu, select Library|Export List...
Choose output folder.
Specify playlist filename.
Set filetype to .m3u.
Click "Save".
Find newly created .m3u playlist using the Windows File Explorer.
Right-click on the playlist file.
Click on "Synchronize with AudioStick".

NOTE: The above process might need to be adapted for your particular
version of iTunes.
Installation
To install AudioStick, you must first install a copy of the Julia programming
language.  Next, you simply follow a few steps to install AudioStick and
register it to your Windows Explorer context menu.
Installing Julia

Go to the Julia language download page http://julialang.org/downloads/.
Download one of the Windows Self-Extracting Archives (.exe).  The 64-bit version is highly recommended, if supported by your operating system.
Launch the downloaded file to install Julia.

Installing AudioStick


Lauch Julia.


Install source:
julia> ]
pkg> add https://github.com/ma-laforge/AudioStick


Generate setup information file (.inf):
julia> using AudioStick
julia> AudioStick.writeinf()


Note the current working directory (CWD):
julia> pwd()


Install the AudioStick context menu from the auto-generated .inf file:

In Windows Explorer, right-click on:
[CWD]\AudioStick_AddWinExContextMenu.inf
Click Install.



Known limitations

AudioStick currently only works on Windows, but could probably be ported to
   other platforms with little effort.
Duplicate tracks will each take up the entire memory space required by the
   original file.  This is because most of the tested consumer audio equipment
   would only support FAT32 USB drives - and the FAT32 system does not support
   softlinks.

Compatibility
AudioStick has been tested using the following environment(s):

Windows 10 / Julia v1.5.1
