Works

2011--present: Founder, Coscience \
Coscience is a non-profit "collaboration startup", working with (not for) individual academic colleagues on computational engineering and science projects in an agile setting. Projects will focus on simulation, statistics, machine learning, data mining, artificial life, and data visualization. It is currently "under the radar". \
Ann Arbor, MI
2010--2015: Co-Owner, Workantile Coworking Community \
Workantile is a self-sustaining membership community for freelancers, remote employees, and independents who would otherwise work on their own at home or in coffee shops. It provides a social foundation for the new "gig economy". \
Ann Arbor, MI
2008--2011: Co-Owner, Vague Innovation, LLC \
Vague Innovation provided business planning and strategic advice to businesses traditionally ignored by Business Development organizations: independents, creative freelancers, and members of the "gig economy". \
Ann Arbor, MI
2000--2002: Founder, Data Pageant, LLC \
Data Pageant produced machine learning systems focused on what today is called really Big Data: real-time technical equities traders and corporate intelligence systems. \
Ann Arbor, MI
1995--2007: Principal, Tozier Consulting \
Introductory and advanced tutorials on agent-based modeling, agile methodologies applied to research projects, data mining and simulation, and evolutionary algorithms applications. \
