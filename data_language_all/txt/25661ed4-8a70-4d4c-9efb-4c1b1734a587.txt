Silencer - control the internet
Silencer is an extension for Google Chrome that allows you to mute terms, phrases, hashtags or people on Twitter and Facebook.
It is currently in its early stages and is always rapidly evolving.
Installation Instructions

Do git clone git@github.com:zackshapiro/silencer.git
Go to chrome://extensions, make sure Developer Mode is checked
Click Load unpacked extension and navigate to the cloned repo, wherever you stored it
You only need to navigate into the Silencer directory and press select for Chrome to load the extension
Any time you make a change to the code make sure you go to your tab with chrome://extensions open and refresh to get the latest code

Other notes

To auto-compile .coffee files into .js files, in your terminal navigate to /Silencer/src and type coffee -cw . This will auto compile CofeeScript files into JavaScript files when you save. It will also show you any indent errors or reasons the CoffeeScript file couldn't be saved
You have to develop in the master branch, as far as I can tell. Chrome doesn't seem to recognize code that's in a branch that you're actively working on
The latest production build of Silencer can be found here
