Create a character scene tutorial
This project is the source for the Create a Base Character Scene in Godot 3 tutorial.
The video shows how to set up a base Character scene and have a Player and a NonPlayableCharacter that inherits from it. This setup isn't necessary in every project, but scene inheritance is a powerful feature that's worth looking at.
