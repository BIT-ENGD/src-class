NATS Straming
NATS itself seems to be a network abstraction and not a datastore
(there seems to be no persistence) so it is not supported.

Administration:
A cluster ID shared by all nodes: user defined in agent configuration (only available in the API when node is FT_ACTIVE).
A cluster-unique ID for the node: server_id from /streaming/serverz.
Version information: version from /streaming/serverz.

[Optional] An operation friendly cluster display name: unavailable.


Clustering: the NATS straming process, MUST BE in fault tolerant mode.


Sharding: (A shard is a fault tolerance group)

A shard ID: the FT group name, user defined in agent configuration.

[Optional] An indicator of when the last write operation happened (commit offset): unavailable.


Replication:

Which shards are on the node: only one, the fault tolerance group.
For each shard, what the role on the node is: user defined in agent configuration (can't get FT name from API).
[Optional] For each non-primary shard, the replication lag: null (technically depends on backing store).
