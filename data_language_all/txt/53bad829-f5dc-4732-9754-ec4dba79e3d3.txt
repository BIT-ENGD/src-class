gps-share
Utility to share your GPS device on local network.
Git master build status: 
Goals
gps-share has the following goals:

Share your GPS device on the local network so that all machines in your home
  or office can make use of it.
Enable support for standalone (i-e not part of a cellular modem) GPS devices
  in Geoclue. Since Geoclue has been able to make use of network NMEA sources
  since 2015, gps-share works out of the box with Geoclue.
Enable multiple applications to share the GPS stream on the same machine.

The latter means that it is a replacement for
GPSD and
Gypsy. While "why not GPSD?" has already
been documented, Gypsy has
been unmaintained for many years now. I did not feel like reviving a dead
project and I really wanted to code in Rust so I decided to create gps-share.

Dependencies
The developers use the latest rustc release and if you use an older version of
the compiler, you may encounter issues. While cargo manages the Rust crates
gps-share depend on, you'll also need the following on your host:

libudev

Supported devices
gps-share currently only supports GPS devices that present themselves as serial
port (RS232). Many USB are expected to work out of the box but bluetooth devices
need manual intervention to be mounted as serial port devices through rfcomm
command. The following command worked on my Fedora 25 machine for a TomTom
Wireless GPS MkII.
sudo rfcomm connect 0 00:0D:B5:70:54:75

gps-share can autodetect the device to use if it's already mounted as a serial
port but it assumes a baudrate of 38400. You can manually set the device node to
use by passing the device node path as argument and set the baudrate using the
'-b' commandline option. For example for the TomTom Wireless GPS MkII device,
you'll nee to set the baudrate to 115200.
Pass '--help' for a full list of supported commandline options.
Permisions
gps-share will need read and write access to device nodes. Adding your user to
'dialout' group gives you this access for USB devices on Fedora hosts but it is
not the case for the /dev/rfcomm0 device created by the above mentioned command.
For those devices, you'll either need to run gps-share as root or set permission
on /dev/rfcomm0.
Supported operating systems
gps-share is targetted specifically for Linux. It may or may not work on other
POSIX hosts. Patches to add/fix support for non-Linux systems, are more than
welcome.
Remember to configure your firewall to allow your service to be reachable on the
local network, as needed.
Building from source
Just like most Rust projects, gps-share uses cargo build system so building is
as simple as:
cargo build

Once built, binary is in target/debug/gps-share. If you want to build
gps-share for production use, with all optimizations:
cargo build --release

which puts the binary in target/release/gps-share. You can also run the binary
directly (without building first):
cargo run

If you need to pass any arguments or options to the commandline, you do:
cargo run -- [ARGUMENT1 [ARGUMENT2 [..]]]

To see all supported options and arguments, run:
cargo run -- --help

Command-line usage
The general call to gps-share is the following:
gps-share [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [device]

The device is either the path to the relevant GNSS device, of - for standard input.
Options

-b, --baudrate <BAUDRATE> Baudrate to use for communication with GPS device
-n, --network-interface <INTERFACE> Place the listening TCP socket on specific network interface (default: all)
-p, --port <PORT> Port to run TCP service on (default: 10110)
-s, --socket-path <SOCKET> Listen on a local socket with the specified path (default: don't listen on a local socket)

Flags

-a, --disable-announce Disable announcing through Avahi
-h, --help Prints help information
-x, --no-tcp Don't listen on TCP sockets at all
-V, --version Prints version information

Testing
The test suite includes end-to-end tests. They share sockets, and should be run in a serial manner:
cargo test
