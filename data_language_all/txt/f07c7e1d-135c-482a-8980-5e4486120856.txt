NOT IN DEVELOPMENT ANYMORE
This project is not developed anymore and just left here for archival purposes.
If you need a quest addon for 1.12 take a look at pfQuest.
ClassicDB
ClassicDB is an addon for World of Warcraft (1.12.1), which helps you to find ingame stuff and getting your quests done. It draws spawn information of gameobjects and NPCs on your map. Also it allows you to search for quests, items and much more. Cartographer is required and an enhanced version is included in the download.
Note: ClassicDB is not meant to be a QuestHelper clone, although it offers quest tracking features via a simple GUI. ClassicDB is mainly a database addon (basically an updated ShaguQuest), and therefore has a higher memory use (due to the way item data is stored and accessed, it takes ~150 MB in memory instead of the ~20 MB it has in the file, but that should not be a problem for a modern PC). If you are searching for just a QuestHelper addon, which is easier on your memory, you might want to check out a project called Questie instead of ClassicDB (of course you can use both together).
Credits
Initially developed as ShaguQuest 8, ClassicDB is a fork of WowHead DataBase (WHDB) for TBC by UniRing, which was ported to classic WoW by Bërsërk in the RQP (Rapid Quest Pack) addon collection. It was merged together from two independently developed forks, ShaguQuest and Continued WHDB. ClassicDB is based on data from cmangos/classic-db, as well as MangosExtras/MangosZero_Localised for translations used in the deDE version.
