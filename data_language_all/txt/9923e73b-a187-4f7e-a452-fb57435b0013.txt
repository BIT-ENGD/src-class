Thoughts on Actor:


actor is good for asynchronous operation, don't need to care about return value


actor is good for scalable work


you need to define a segregation line between synchronize code and actor(asynchronize) code.


if you care about the return value of a actor, you may want to imply ask pattern


Future could also be used to represent a time-consuming operation, and use mapTo method to collect the result of Future


json serialization/deserialization, use spray-json, have to import a XXXJsonProtocol to get implicit Marshaller/Unmarshaller while defining routes
