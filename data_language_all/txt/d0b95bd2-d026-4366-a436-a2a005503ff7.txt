FIXMEs
JSON mode format

do not force the user to select the entire buffer (mark region)
do not replace entire contents with error message when syntax error is present

save in JSON mode
Automatcially reformat like in go mode.
Depends on a fix for JSON mode format.
Top Ten
Things that would be useful.
If not already written by someone, good things for me to learn .el with.
git-find-file
Like find-file (C-x C-f), except
* C-x C-g
* uses git ls-files
* default to top directory of repo
* provide a way to search from current directory
 * of buffer from which it was launched
 * perhaps do this as a separate command
* does substring matching like switch-to-buffer, this:
 * .go<tab>, all files with substring .go (essentially all go files)
 * foo<tab>, all files with substring foo
* need to somehow list the full directory path
* perhaps may be done better as some sort of speed bar
godef and Source Paths
Fix to allow . dir/path.
godef and All Places Where Foo is Used
Provide some sort of way to find out all places something is being used.
Examples:
* all places where function is invoked
* all places where type is being used
* all places where a variable is being used
 * example: some dumbass thinks it is a good idea to have a variable named s at the top of a very long function, you want to see all places where s is being referenced in that function (read from or set).  isearch-forward (C-s), shows you all s.  That's not what you want.  You want all instances of the variable s.
git-grep

allow git grep from emacs.
allow choosing files (like speed bar)
have a mode such that it does git grep -l (list files only)

Persistent Buffer List
Much like command line history in bash, it would
be nice if the list of buffers that emacs has open
would be continuously saved somewhere (saved when buffers
are created and deleted).  Occasionally, VM crashes or
emacs crashes and would like to pick up where I left off.
Also, when working on different projects, would like to
name those projects.
Summary:
* %> newscr edit Project-1 emacs would load 'Project-1' buffers
* ^J, screen -t Project-2 2 emacs would load 'Project-2' buffers
* as files are loaded and buffers are killed, the list is updated then (it is always up to date, I do not want to be required to explicitly save the list every so often, this should happened when the buffer list changes automatically)
Ideas:
* see if desktop-save can be used
 currently using desktop-save to save session to a directory under ~/desktop/
 currently using desktop-change-dir to switch to ~/desktop/
* would recentf-mode help?
* consider keying off the same shell environment variables that are set up when screen starts

Would have something that looked like this:
-UUU:%%--F1  *GNU Emacs*    All (1,0)      (Fundamental) -----------------------------
For information about GNU Emacs and the GNU system, type C-h C-a.
[ paul-sc ][            1-$ Project-1  2*$ Project-2            ][ 09/01/15 12:46 PM ]
[ paul-mac-pro ][          1- MacOSX-EDIT  2* SC-EDIT           ][ 09/01/15 12:46 PM ]
The last buffer list for Project-1 would automatically be loaded upon executing this command:
[paul@paul-sc:~/sc-minipoc/skycontrol/src]
%> newscr edit Project-1 emacs
