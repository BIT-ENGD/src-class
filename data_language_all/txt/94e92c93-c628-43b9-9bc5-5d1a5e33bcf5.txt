otouto
The plugin-wielding, multipurpose Telegram bot.
Public Bot | Official Channel | Development Group | Owner's Manual
otouto is an independently-developed Telegram API bot written in Lua. Originally conceived as a CLI script in February of 2015, otouto has since been open-sourced and migrated to the API, and is being developed to this day.
Setup {#Setup}
You must have Lua (5.2+), lua-socket, lua-sec, and lua-cjson installed. To upload files, you must have curl installed. To use fortune.lua, you must have fortune installed.
Before doing anything, open config.lua and set bot_api_key to the authentication token you received from the Botfather.
You may want to set: admin, your Telegram ID; time_offset, a positive or negative number, denoting the difference, in seconds, of your system clock to UTC; and lang, a lowercase, two-letter code representing your language. Some plugins are not enabled by default. If you wish to enable them, add them to the plugins table (before help.lua).
To start the bot, run ./launch.sh. To stop the bot, send "/halt" from your admin account, and then Ctrl+C out of the loop. If you terminate the bot manually, you risk data loss. If you do not wish the bot to restart automatically, run it with lua bot.lua.
Note that certain plugins, such as translate.lua and greetings.lua, will require privacy mode to be disabled. Additionally, some plugins may require or make use of various API keys:

weather.lua: OpenWeatherMap API key
lastfm.lua: last.fm API key
bible.lua: Biblia API key
cats.lua: The Cat API API key (optional)
gImages.lua: Google API and CSE keys
youtube.lua: Google API key
apod.lua: NASA API key
translate.lua: Yandex API key
chatter.lua: SimSimi API key


Plugins {#Plugins}
otouto uses a robust plugin system, similar to that of yagop's Telegram-Bot. The aim of the otouto project is to contain any desirable bot feature within one universal bot framework.
Most plugins are intended for public use, but a few are for other purposes, like those used alongside Liberbot, or for use by the bot's owner. See Development for a breakdown of the components of a plugin, or here for a list of plugins.
A plugin can have five components, and two of them are required:
| Component | Description | Required? |
|:----------|:------------|:----------|
| action | The main function. It accepts the msg table as an argument. | Y |
| triggers | A table of commands to be used for the plugin. Use Lua patterns. | Y |
| cron | An optional function to be called approximately every minute. | N |
| command | The basic command and syntax. This is listed in the help text. | N |
| doc | Usage and other info for the plugin. This is returned with "/help command" | N |
The on_msg_receive() function adds a few variables to the msg table for your convenience. These are self-explanatory: msg.from.id_str, msg.to.id_str, msg.chat.id_str, msg.text_lower, msg.from.name.
Return values from action() are optional, but they do effect the flow. If it returns a table, that table will become msg, and on_msg_receive will continue with that. If it returns true, it will continue with the current msg.
When an action or cron function fails, the exception is caught and passed to the handle_exception() utilty (in utilities.lua) and is either printed to the console or send to the chat/channel defined in log_chat in config.lua.
Interactions with the bot API are straightforward. Every binding function shares the name of the API method (eg sendMessage()). An additional function, sendReply(), accepts the msg table and a string as an argument, and sends the string as a reply to that message.
Several functions used in multiple plugins are defined in utilities.lua. Refer to that file for usage and documentation.

Control plugins {#Control_plugins}
Some plugins are designed to be used by the bot's owner. Here are some examples, how they're used, and what they do.
| Plugin | Command | Function |
|:-------|:--------|:---------|
| control.lua | /reload | Reloads all plugins and configuration. |
| control.lua | /halt | Saves the database and shuts down the bot properly. |
| blacklist.lua | /blacklist | Allows the admin to list people the bot will ignore. |
| shell.lua | /run | Executes shell commands on the host operating system. |
| luarun.lua | /lua | Executes Lua commands in the bot's environement. |

administration.lua {#administration.lua}
The administration plugin enables self-hosted, single-realm group administration, supporting both normal groups and supergroups. This works by sending TCP commands to an instance of tg running on the owner's account.
To get started, run ./tg-install.sh. Note that this script is written for Ubuntu/Debian. If you're running Arch (the only acceptable alternative), you'll have to do it yourself. If that is the case, note that otouto uses the "test" branch of tg, and the AUR package telegram-cli-git will not be sufficient, as it does not have support for supergroups yet.
Once the installation is finished, enable administration.lua in your config file. You may have reason to change the default TCP port (4567); if that is the case, remember to change it in tg-launch.sh as well. Run ./tg-launch.sh in a separate screen/tmux window. You'll have to enter your phone number and go through the login process the first time. The script is set to restart tg after two seconds, so you'll need to Ctrl+C after exiting.
While tg is running, you may start/reload otouto with administration.lua enabled, and have access to a wide variety of administrative commands and automata. The administration "database" is stored in administration.json. To start using otouto to administrate a group (note that you must be the owner (or an administrator)), send /gadd to that group. For a list of commands, use /ahelp. Below I'll describe various functions now available to you.
| Command | Function | Privilege | Internal? |

| /gadd | Adds a group to the administrative system. | 5 | N |
| /grem | Removes a group from the administrative system | 5 | Y |
| /broadcast | Broadcasts a message to all administrated groups. | 5 | N |
Internal commands can only be run within an administrated group.
Description of Privileges
| # | Title | Description | Scope |

| 0 | Banned | Cannot enter the group(s). | Either |
| 1 | User | Default rank. | Local |

Obviously, each greater rank inherits the privileges of the lower, positive ranks.

Liberbot-related plugins {#Liberbot-related_plugins}
Note: This section may be out of date. The Liberbot-related plugins have not changed in very long time.
Some plugins are only useful when the bot is used in a Liberbot group, like floodcontrol.lua and moderation.lua.
floodcontrol.lua makes the bot compliant with Liberbot's floodcontrol function. When the bot has posted too many messages to a single group in a given period of time, Liberbot will send it a message telling it to cease posting in that group. Here is an example floodcontrol command:
/floodcontrol {"groupid":987654321,"duration":600}
The bot will accept these commands from both Liberbot and the configured administrator.
moderation.lua allows the owner to use the bot to moderate a Liberbot realm, or set of groups. This works by adding the bot to the realm's admin group and making it an administrator.
You must configure the plugin in the "moderation" section of config.lua, in the following way:
lua
moderation = {
    admins = {
        ['123456789'] = 'Adam',
        ['246813579'] = 'Eve'
    },
    admin_group = -987654321,
    realm_name = 'My Realm'
}
Where Adam and Eve are realm administrators, and their IDs are set as their keys in the form of strings. admin_group is the group ID of the admin group, as a negative number. realm_name is the name of your Libebot realm.
Once this is set up, put your bot in the admin group and run /modadd and /modhelp to get started.

Style {#Style}
Bot output from every plugin should follow a consistent style. This style is easily observed interacting with the bot.
Titles should be either bold (along with their colons) or a link (with plaintext colons) to the content's source. Names should be italic. Numbered lists should use bold numbers followed by a bold period followed by a space. Unnumbered lists should use the • bullet point followed by a space. Descriptions and information should be in plaintext, although "flavor" text should be italic. Technical information should be monospace. Links should be named.
