errer - smooth & flexible error management
with ideas from failure and SNAFU.
Rundown

A few tips

Context is dependent on from to specify the base error; take a peek at the internal traits for more information.
You can use all the attributes on structs and the outside of enums (to set defaults) as well.
You can use #[errer(context = name)] to set the name of the generated context struct.
Similarly, you can use #[errer(from = member)] to set the member that from uses.
You can use display on the outside of enums to set a surrounding format string.
And remember that you can always implement Display yourself.
