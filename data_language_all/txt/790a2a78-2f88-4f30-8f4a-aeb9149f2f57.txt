ROS Tutorials - ROS TF, unit testing, bag files
Overview
These programs demonstrate the various concepts of ROS like publisher/subscriber nodes, services, tf and rostest. The talker node continuously publishes messages on the topic "chatter" as well as a constant tf transform. The listener node subscribes to the topic /chatter and receives the messages. There is a service called edit base string that can be used to modify a string within a program. All 5 logger levels are implemented in the code. The launch file included can be used to run all nodes and the service from a single command. It also records all messages being published on all topics in a bagfile. The code also uses gtest/rostest to implement a lever 2 integration test that tests the tf transform and the service of the talker node.

Build Instructions
If you do not have a catkin workspace, follow this:
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
cd src/
git clone --recursive https://github.com/inani47/beginner_tutorials.git
cd ..
catkin_make
If you wish to run this code in an existing catkin workspace:
cd ~/catkin_ws/
source devel/setup.bash
cd src/
git clone --recursive https://github.com/inani47/beginner_tutorials.git
cd ..
catkin_make
Run Instructions
After following the build instructions:
Set environment vairables and run roscore in a new terminal:
source devel/setup.bash
roscore
Set environment variables and first run string editor service node from a new terminal:
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun beginner_tutorials stringEditorService.cpp
Set environment variables and run talker node from a new terminal:
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun beginner_tutorials talker
Set environment variables and run listener node from a new terminal:
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun beginner_tutorials listener
Run Instructions Using Launch File
After following the build instructions:
In a new terminal:
cd ~/catkin_ws/
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch beginner_tutorials Week_11HW.launch
To lower the publishing frequency using commind-line arguments:
Set environment variables and run talker node from a new terminal:
cd ~/catkin_ws/
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch beginner_tutorials Week_11HW.launch pubRate:=1
To Run service from command-line
This service takes in any give string and outputs a constant string.
To run the service, in a new terminal:
cd ~/catkin_ws/
source devel/setup.bash
rosservice call /editBaseString "input: '<any_string>'"
To Inspect TF frames
First run the string editor service and talker node from the terminal from the catkin workspace (since talker waits for the service to start):
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun beginner_tutorials stringEditorService.cpp
rosrun beginner_tutorials talker
To run view_frames tool, from a new terminal:
rosrun tf view_frames
This will create a diagram of the frames being broadcast by tf over ROS in the folder from where the command was run.
To look at the transform being broadcast between the world frame and the talk frame. In a new terminal run the following command:
rosrun tf tf_echo world talk
Running Rostest
To run rostest:
cd ~/catkin_ws/build
make run_tests
This will build and run two tests which tests the service and the tf transform of the talker node.
Recording and Playing bag files
To record bag files simply run the launch file from a new terminal:
cd ~/catkin_ws/
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch beginner_tutorials Week_11HW.launch
To disable bag file recording use the "rec" argument while running the launchfile:
cd ~/catkin_ws/
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch beginner_tutorials Week_11HW.launch rec:=1
To inspect the bag file go the folder where bag file was saved. For our convenience an example bag file is present in the results folder. In a new terminal
cd ~/catkin_ws/
source devel/setup.bash
cd src/beginner_tutorials/results
rosbag info recording.bag
To playback the bag file and to verify that it is publishing on all the recorded topics.
First run the listener node on a new terminal:
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun beginner_tutorials listener
Now from the results folder run the following command in the terminal:
rosbag play recording.bag
You will see that listener will start receiving messages being published on topic /chatter.
