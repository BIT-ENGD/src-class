Highlightr



Highlightr is an iOS & macOS syntax highlighter built with Swift. It uses highlight.js as it core, supports 169 languages and comes with 77 styles.
Takes your lame string with code and returns a NSAttributtedString with proper syntax highlighting.


Usage
Highlightr provides two main classes:
Highlightr
This is the main endpoint, you can use it to convert code strings into NSAttributted strings.
```Swift
    let highlightr = Highlightr()
    highlightr.setTheme(to: "paraiso-dark")
    let code = "let a = 1"
    // You can omit the second parameter to use automatic language detection.
    let highlightedCode = highlightr.highlight(code, as: "swift") 
Swift
    let textStorage = CodeAttributedString()
    textStorage.language = "Swift"
    let layoutManager = NSLayoutManager()
    textStorage.addLayoutManager(layoutManager)
let textContainer = NSTextContainer(size: view.bounds.size)
layoutManager.addTextContainer(textContainer)

let textView = UITextView(frame: yourFrame, textContainer: textContainer)

```
JavaScript?
Yes, Highlightr relies on iOS & macOS JavaScriptCore to parse the code using highlight.js. This is actually quite fast!
Performance
It will never be as fast as a native solution, but it's fast enough to be used on a real time editor.
It comes with a custom made HTML parser for creating NSAttributtedStrings, is pre-processing the themes and is preloading the JS libraries. As result it's taking around of 50 ms on my iPhone 6s for processing 500 lines of code.
