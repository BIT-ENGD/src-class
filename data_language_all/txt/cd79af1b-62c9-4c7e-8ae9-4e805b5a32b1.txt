dm-vbulletin
vBuletin forums data extraction tool
This is actually an experiment of using Akka-Streams to process and transform some data from WEB-services, with page transformation and data extraction.
So far this tool allows to crawl some vBulletin-based forums, using user-id and password for an existing account, to
- extract the profile data as an unsorted map
- extract lists of likes per user to build sort of a social graph
The plan is to add some Spark-ML processing to allow extraction of
- user clusters
- registration spikes and gauge
- registration anomalies
- etc
