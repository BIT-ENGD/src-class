getpower.sh     driver script
models      R-based models for power estimation (see README in model/ for details)         
data        sample data sets for training and testing models 
Build and Intsall Instructions
The power estimation models require R (and Rscript) to be installed on the
system. If you don't have R installed and in your path, install R before using
powertools. 
To build and install powertools 

untar the archive
cd into the powertools directory 

type 
         ./configure 

add powertools/bin to your PATH or copy powertools/bin/getpower.sh to a
  preferred location 



Using powertools
getpower.sh is the main driver script. This should be placed in a directory in
your PATH. Type "getpower.sh --help" for details on usage.  
Examples
To estimate processor power consumption on Intel with the ANN model, type 
  getpower.sh PWRTOOLS/models ann --predict test.dat

where 
  - PWRTOOLS is the install location of powertools 
  - test.dat is the input file with space-seperated values for the following six counters
       - "UNHALTED_CLK_CYCLES"
       - "INSTR_RETIRED_ANY"
       - "UOPS_RETIRED_ALL",
       - "BR_INST_RETIRED_ALL_BRANCHES"
       - "BR_INST_RETIRED_CONDITIONAL"
       - "L2_RQSTS_MISS"
