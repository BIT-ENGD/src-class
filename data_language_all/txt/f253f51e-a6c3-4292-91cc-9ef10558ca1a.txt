Omn Sprites 
This crate is an exercise in learning! 
Please don't depend on this for your job.
The overall goal is to make management of sprite 
sheet data convenient by using a video playback 
metaphor. Sprite sheets can be tagged with "clips" 
which can support multiple play modes. 
The code was originally part of omn-labs-rs, which is 
an incubator project for random game dev ideas.
Currently the crate is built around export data from 
Aseprite but I hope to 
support more content creation apps later.
