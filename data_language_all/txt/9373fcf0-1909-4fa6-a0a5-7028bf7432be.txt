atomic-rest package
Dirty REST API tester for Atom Editor.
Install
shell
apm install atomic-rest
Use
In editor, type a request block like that:
GET http://api.twitter.com/1.1/search/tweets.json
Select request block and type alt-ctrl-enter to get response along with headers, like that:

You can also add a request body, formated as CSON. It will be converted to JSON and appropriate headers will be set. So, assuming there is an API endpoint there:

Notes
CSON Safe is used for parsing request body. It has a known issue with array of objects syntax. You have to write them like that:
coffeescript
cats: [
  {
    name: "Katiusza"
    mood: "Playful"
  }
  {
    name: "George"
    mood: "Weltschmerz"
  }
]
BTW, if you can't stand the absence of curly braces and colons, you can write strict JSON documents as a request body. Everything that is valid JSON is a valid CSON as well. So, feel at home :)
TODOs


Automatic request block selection
to allow triggering request with cursor inside the block, without the need to select it manually.


Authentication


Cookies


Many more, probably...
