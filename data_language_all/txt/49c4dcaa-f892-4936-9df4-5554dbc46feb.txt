Grains
Calculate the number of grains of wheat on a chessboard given that the number
on each square doubles.
There once was a wise servant who saved the life of a prince. The king
promised to pay whatever the servant could dream up. Knowing that the
king loved chess, the servant told the king he would like to have grains
of wheat. One grain on the first square of a chess board. Two grains on
the next. Four on the third, and so on.
There are 64 squares on a chessboard.
Write code that shows:
- how many grains were on each square, and
- the total number of grains
For bonus points
Did you get the tests passing and the code clean? If you want to, these
are some additional things you could try:

Optimize for speed.
Optimize for readability.

Then please share your thoughts in a comment on the submission. Did this
experiment make the code better? Worse? Did you learn anything from it?
Resources
Remember to check out the Perl 6 documentation and
resources pages for information, tips, and
examples if you get stuck.
Running the tests
There is a test suite and module included with the exercise.
The test suite (a file with the extension .t) will attempt to run routines
from the module (a file with the extension .pm6).
Add/modify routines in the module so that the tests will pass! You can view the
test data by executing the command perl6 --doc *.t (* being the name of the
test suite), and run the test suite for the exercise by executing the command
prove . --exec=perl6 in the exercise directory.
You can also add the -v flag e.g. prove . --exec=perl6 -v to display all
tests, including any optional tests marked as 'TODO'.
