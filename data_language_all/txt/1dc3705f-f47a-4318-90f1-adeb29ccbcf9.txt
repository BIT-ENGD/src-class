Troubleshooting
If you have this exception javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: General SSLEngine problem add the certificate of the twitter api to jre truststore. 
bash
echo -n | \
openssl s_client -connect api.twitter.com:443 </dev/null | \
sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > /tmp/twitter-api.crt && \
sudo keytool -import -trustcacerts -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit -noprompt -alias twitterapi -file /tmp/twitter-api.crt
if the alias already exists, delete it before.
