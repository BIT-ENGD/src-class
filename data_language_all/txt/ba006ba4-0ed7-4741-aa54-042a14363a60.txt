Dart Angles
Official Dart package
This package provides an Angle type seeking to eliminate the use of variable suffixes like ...deg or ...rad
as well as manual angle unit conversions such as x * rad2deg and the likes.
Therefore, this package's raison d'être is not to serve features but to increase code maintainability,
thus reducing maintaince cost and bugs.
Angles can be constructed from these units: degrees, radians, gradians and turns.
| Unit | Quantity of a full turn |
|--|--|
| Degree | 360° |
| Radian | 2π |
| Gradian | 400ᵍ |
| Turn | 1 |
