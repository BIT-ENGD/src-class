SR(A)WN 2015 — 13
This is the thirteenth issue of the Student Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter, a (roughly) fortnightly newsletter which summarises the goings‐on across Student Robotics. Emboldened items are ones which we believe could do with extra hands. An absence of emboldening does not necessarily mean that everything is done.
Internal updates:

Committee steering elections are coming up. Applicants for roles must do so via the mailing list by 26th January. Steering committee roles on Trac have been updated.
Various patches to srweb which move submodules to Puppet have been updated and require reviewing.
Jekyll is being worked on.
Further updates to the power board have been worked on.
Flag design and prototyping for SR2015 has happened.
The improvements to the tools have reached feature completion. People should upgrade to check their workflow hasn't been broken.
More responses relating to charity objections have been posted.

Team updates:

More teams have been asking questions about the mascots on the top of the flags.
