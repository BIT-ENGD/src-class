About
From Laverna:
Laverna is a JavaScript note-taking web application with a Markdown editor and encryption support.  It's built to be an open source alternative to Evernote.
The application stores all your notes in your browser databases such as indexedDB or localStorage, which is good for security reasons, because only you have access to them.
Demo: https://laverna.cc/ OR http://laverna.github.io/static-laverna
