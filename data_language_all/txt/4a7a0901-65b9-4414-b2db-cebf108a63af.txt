MapperMDS

Adaptation from TDA.jl mapper
tool. Here the input is a distance matrix and it uses a hierarchical
clustering. It was inspired by the problems when one only has the
distance matrix of a dataset and not the point cloud itself.
Installation
In the julia REPL
julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("https://github.com/chronchi/MapperMDS.jl.git")
Usage
The usage here is pretty similar to wildart's module.
We have to pass a distance matrix and filter values of the
distance matrix, e.g., MDS using the distance matrix and projecting
to the real line.
The package performs a hierarchical clustering, since it only needs
a distance matrix (or a dissimilarity matrix).
The linkage criteria can be given as a parameter to the function mapper
via linkage = :criteria, where criteria is one of the options here.
You can choose the method to evaluate the quality of the clustering.
The default is no method. You can choose the silhouette
using clustselection = MapperMDS.silhouette. You can then specify the number
of clusters to the hierarchical clustering with n_clusters = k.
The default value is 2. Notice we can use DBScan from the package Clustering. When using DBScan it is important to use the default value of clustselection.
To plot we use the package GraphPlot
together with LightGraphs.
