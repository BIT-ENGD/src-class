My Express App
This is my ongoing, tweaked boilerplate way of using expressjs.

uses coffee-script
mocha, should and zombie for testing
includes contrib client-side stuff
angularjs
angularfire
bootstrap
firebase
jquery

Get it.
git clone git@github.com:msmithgu/my-express.git

Continuously run tests on it.
make dev-test

Continuously serve it for yourself.
make dev-serve

Edit as you will.
