Improved whois support for GNU Emacs
This package complements (does not replace) the standard whois
functionality of GNU Emacs. It provides:


A whois-mode with font-lock highlighting to make whois responses
  easier to read.


A whois-shell command to make a whois query using the system whois
  program instead of Emacs' own (often not up to date) whois client.


A whois-expand command to repeat the last whois query using the
  domain registrar's own whois server.


To replace Emacs' own whois command with the one from this package:
(when (require 'whois nil t) (defalias 'whois 'whois-shell))
