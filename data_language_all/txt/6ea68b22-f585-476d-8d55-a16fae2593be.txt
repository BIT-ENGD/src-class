Building
Since we're using rocket as our REST framework the nightly rust compiler
must be used.
With the nightly rust compiler installed run the command to build the
application:
cargo build
Running the application
Before executing the server a mongodb server must be executed and available
for it. So the first step is to put a mongodb database server in execution.
The code block inside the file main.rs defines its host and port:
rust
    let db = Database::create("localhost", 27017).unwrap();
Using notifications
The server uses the Firebase Cloud Messaging - FCM
to send notifications when required to.
In order to use this feature you must have a firebase account with the cloud
messaging enabled. This will provide an Authorization key which must be
updated in the source code, inside the file notification/mod.rs
rust
const KEY: &'static str = "put-yout-FCM-key-here";
replacing the constant value with it.
Without a valid key all notification request will receive a 403 from the
server.
