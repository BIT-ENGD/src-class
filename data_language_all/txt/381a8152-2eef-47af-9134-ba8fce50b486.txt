FreeStyle InsuLinx
Reverse engineered by Xavier Claessens.
Protocol
This device uses the shared HID protocol used by other
meters in the FreeStyle family. All messages that have been identified are
considered text commands and use message type 0x60.
Commands
All commands supported by the shared protocol are supported by the device. Those
that deviate from said protocol are here documented.
$result?
The $result? command is used to dump the readings records from the device, and
it follows the Multiple records command output format as described in the
shared protocol documentation.
The first field in the record specify the type of record; type 0 is a blood
glucose reading.
