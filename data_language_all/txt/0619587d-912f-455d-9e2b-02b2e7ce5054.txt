Hello, World!
This example shows how to create a smart contract in Rust that prints a greeting, without using the eosio crate. This is used to demonstrate the code that is being abstracted away, and to compare the abstraction overhead.
Usage
sh
cleos push action hello hi '["world"]' -p 'hello@active'
