Codecov Swift Example
 
This repository serves as an example on how to use Codecov Global for Swift.
Usage
Enable "Gather coverage data" in your test scheme:

Travis CI
Add to your .travis.yml file.
yml
language: swift # or objective-c
osx_image: xcode7
script:
  - xcodebuild -scheme SwiftExample -workspace SwiftExample.xcworkspace -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 6S,OS=9.1' build test
after_success:
  - bash <(curl -s https://codecov.io/bash)
Private Repos

Set CODECOV_TOKEN in your environment variables.

Add to your .travis.yml file.
yml
after_success:
  - bash <(curl -s https://codecov.io/bash) -t uuid-repo-token

Or you can set the environment variable CODECOV_TOKEN to your token.

Speed up the build
The uploader has a boil-the-ocean approach, which can take a longer time to complete coverage report processing.
We suggest you add the following to only build reports for the project being tested:
sh
bash <(curl -s https://codecov.io/bash) -J 'SwiftExample'

Use your project name instead of SwiftExample. You can also provide multiple arguments via -J 'ProjA' -J 'ProjB'

Caveats
Xcode8/Swift3 resulting in 0% coverage.

Update the test scheme with Xcode 8
Do not use xcpretty. Seems broken with code coverage Xcode 8...

Example project with Xcode8/Swift3: yannickl/DynamicColor
