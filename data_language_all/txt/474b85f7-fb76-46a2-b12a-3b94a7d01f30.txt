tests: no double rounding, rounds without extra precison, chip/software fma works
Just copy the raw file (or the file text) and paste it into your REPL
There are only three tests, and they take much less time than does pasting.
If they pass you will see
The numerics tested work properly.
If any test does not pass, or the version of Julia in use does not support fma, that information is shown.  It would be generally useful to know the test that failed and versioninfo().
I want to rely on capabilities that are very widely shared.
