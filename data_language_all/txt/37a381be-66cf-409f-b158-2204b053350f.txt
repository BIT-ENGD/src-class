Purpose
Connect Hogan.js with Express, with support for Partials.

Why is Hogan.js Awesome?
Logic-less templates, keeping control separate from views. Views separated from content.
Doesn't have many bells and whistles. HTML Structure, and views are suppose to be simple.
Mustache is awesome. Has many implementations. It's clear what's a {{variable}} and what is not.
Why Hulk-Hogan?
Becaues he's awesome. But also because there wasn't a solution I could find that let's you easily use Mustaches' partials natively with Express.
Partials Example
body.hulk
{{> header}}
  My body.
  {{> footer}}
header.hulk

footer.hulk

Produces:


Sub-Partials supported
You can link partials from within other partials.

Usage Example
views/index.hulk
mustache
Hello {{what}}!
CoffeScript
app.coffee

coffee app.coffee http://localhost:3000 would produce: 

Hello World!

JavaScript
app.js

node app.js http://localhost:3000 would produce:

Hello World!

Automated Tests
Hulk-Hogan uses mocha & mocha-cakes for testing.
make buffet should run all tests.
