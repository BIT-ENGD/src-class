NOTE: This crate is entirely superseded by the very excellent num-format, which has all the features of separator and much, much more. I highly recommend using num-format instead of this crate.
Formats numbers into strings with thousands separators for readability. It currently supports floating-points (f32 and f64), unsigned integers (u16, u32, u64, u128), signed integers (i16, i32, i64, i128), and size types (isize and usize).
Usage
First, put separator as a dependency in your Cargo.toml as usual:
[dependencies]
separator = "0.3.1"
Then, import the Separatable trait, and call the separated_string on a number:
