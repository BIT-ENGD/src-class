
A reasonable Emacs config
This is my emacs configuration tree, continually used and tweaked
since 2000, and it may be a good starting point for other Emacs
users, especially those who are web developers. These days it's
somewhat geared towards OS X, but it is known to also work on Linux
and Windows.
Emacs itself comes with support for many programming languages. This
config adds improved defaults and extended support for the following:

Ruby / Ruby on Rails
CSS / LESS / SASS / SCSS
HAML / Markdown / Textile / ERB
Clojure (with Cider and nRepl)
Javascript / Coffeescript
Python
PHP
Haskell
Erlang
Common Lisp (with Slime)

In particular, there's a nice config for tab autocompletion, and
flycheck is used to immediately highlight syntax errors in Ruby, HAML,
Python, Javascript, PHP and a number of other languages.
Requirements

Emacs 23.3 or greater (note that Emacs 24 is required for some
  functionality, and will likely become the minimum required version
  some time soon.)
To make the most of the programming language-specific support in
  this config, further programs will likely be required, particularly
  those that flycheck uses to
  provide on-the-fly syntax checking.

Installation
To install, clone this repo to ~/.emacs.d, i.e. ensure that the
init.el contained in this repo ends up at ~/.emacs.d/init.el:
git clone https://github.com/followtheart/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
Upon starting up Emacs for the first time, further third-party
packages will be automatically downloaded and installed. If you
encounter any errors at that stage, try restarting Emacs, and possibly
running M-x package-refresh-contents before doing so.
Important note about ido
This config enables ido-mode completion in the minibuffer wherever
possible, which might confuse you when trying to open files using
C-x C-f, e.g. when you want to open a directory to use
dired -- if you get stuck, use C-f to drop into the
regular find-file prompt. (You might want to customize the
ido-show-dot-for-dired variable if this is an issue for you.)
Updates
Update the config with git pull. You'll probably also want/need to update
the third-party packages regularly too:
M-x package-list-packages, then U followed by x.
Adding your own customization
To add your own customization, use M-x customize and/or
create a file ~/.emacs.d/lisp/init-local.el which looks like this:

If you need initialisation code which executes earlier in the startup process,
you can also create an ~/.emacs.d/lisp/init-preload-local.el file.
If you plan to customize things more extensively, you should probably
just fork the repo and hack away at the config to make it your own!
Similar configs
You might also want to check out emacs-starter-kit and prelude.
Support / issues
If you hit any problems, please first ensure that you are using the latest version
of this code, and that you have updated your packages to the most recent available
versions (see "Updates" above). If you still experience problems, go ahead and
file an issue on the github project.
