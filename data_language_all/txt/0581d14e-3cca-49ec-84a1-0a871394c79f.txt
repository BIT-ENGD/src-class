CasaCore.jl
CasaCore.jl is a Julia wrapper of CasaCore,
which is a commonly used library in radio astronomy.
Functionality is divided into two submodules:

CasaCore.Tables for interfacing with tables (for example Casa measurement sets), and
CasaCore.Measures for performing coordinate system conversions (for example calculating the azimuth and elevation of an astronomical target).

Getting Started
Prior to using this package, the CasaCore library must be installed on your machine.
You can then obtain CasaCore.jl by running (from within the Julia REPL):
julia
Pkg.add("CasaCore")
Pkg.test("CasaCore")
If Pkg.add("CasaCore") fails with a build error. Please open a Github issue.
Bugs and Feature Requests
Development of this package is ongoing and largely focused on my own requirements.
If you need additional features, open an issue or a pull request.
In the short term, you can use the excellent PyCall
package to access the Python wrapper of CasaCore (python-casacore).
