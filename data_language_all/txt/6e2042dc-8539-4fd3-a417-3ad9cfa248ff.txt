About
This is a personal shopping and inventory-tracking device based on the Raspberry Pi and off-the-shelf usb barcode scanners, with an option to share and contribute to the Open Product Data (POD) database of product barcodes, as part of the Saruzai Open Data project.
Installation
Quickstart (for the impatient)
Copy or download the pre-built ARM binaries onto your Raspberry Pi (runnning the Raspbian OS), and complete the post-install instructions.
More detailed instructions


Build your Raspberry Pi client from the ground up, either by:

building from source; or
using the pre-built ARM binaries 



Run your own API server (optional, if you do not wish to share and contribute to the barcode data project)
