dotfiles
    
This repo contains the source code for idempotently creating, maintaining, and synchronizing my dotfiles, configuration, and software packages (Homebrew, Yarn, Rust, Python, etc.) on an arbitrary Unix-based operating system (note: the commands used assume macOS).

Installation

Usage
Currently, the install script is incomplete, so while dotfiles will be symbolically linked and Git submodules updated, nothing else (such as installing Homebrew and Yarn dependencies) will occur. This will change soon.
