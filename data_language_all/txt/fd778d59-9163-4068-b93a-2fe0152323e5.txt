docker-webex
Run Cisco WebEx [1] inside docker.
To use it simply clone this repository and run the webex.sh script.
This will build the image and execute firefox in the resulting container
ready to go to the WebEx site.
Please note this runs with --privileged since the LXC built-in
exec driver is no longer available.
Chrome users might want to check the Cisco WebEx App for Chrome [2].
Status

Audio and various sharing options work. 

Webcam video is limited to view-only. This is a limitation on the
  Linux client.
