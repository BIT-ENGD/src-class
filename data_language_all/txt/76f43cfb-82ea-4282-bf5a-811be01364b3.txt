Our next and perhaps most business-like example presents a
three-dimensional bar graph plot showing the geographic distribution of
all the languages of the world. The input data
was taken from Ethnologue <http://www.ethnologue.com/>_. We decide to plot a 3-D column
centered on each continent with a height that is proportional to the
languages used. We choose a plain
linear projection for the basemap and add the columns and text on top.
Eventually we make it a bit more fancy by splitting the columns up in different colors
indicating how commonly the languages are used, from institutional languages to
languages threatened by extinction.
The script also shows how to effectively use transparency of the boxes around the numbers
and in the shade surrounding the legend.
Our script that produces Figure ex_10 reads:
{% highlight bash %}
{% include {{page.script}} %}
{% endhighlight %}
