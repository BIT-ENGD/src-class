Sublime User Settings
This repository contains my personal Sublime Text 2 User settings. These are for running Windows 7 x32 bit OS, if that even matters. Most of the files can remain in the /Sublime Text 2/packages/User/ directory, except for .bashrc which must be moved to the /User/%username%/ directory of the computer account.
Most of the User settings require specific packages to be installed to work, so that means Package Control must be installed first. To install it for Sublime Text 2 press Ctrl + ~  and run this:
import urllib2,os; pf='Package Control.sublime-package'; ipp=sublime.installed_packages_path(); os.makedirs(ipp) if not os.path.exists(ipp) else None; urllib2.install_opener(urllib2.build_opener(urllib2.ProxyHandler())); open(os.path.join(ipp,pf),'wb').write(urllib2.urlopen('http://sublime.wbond.net/'+pf.replace(' ','%20')).read()); print('Please restart Sublime Text to finish installation')
Packages To Install

That have custom User Settings:

DetectSyntax
FileHistory
Gist
JsFormat
Minifier
Sublimelinter
JSHint

Packages to Install Maybe:
Below is a list of all packages I use, or might use for specific projects or preference depending on project needs.
Note: Do NOT have these ALL installed at the same time. That would be retarded.
I have maybe less than half of what's on this list actually installed and use. However, when I checked the list for what I am using I realized there are tons more packages available through Package Control in Sublime that sounded worth checking out and maybe better than the one I use.
I need to separate what I do use on this list too.
