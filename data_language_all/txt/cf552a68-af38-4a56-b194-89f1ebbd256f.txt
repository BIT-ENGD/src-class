GraphLayout.jl
Graph layout and visualization algorithms, implemented in Julia.



Development version:


The package currently implements the following layout methods:

Spring-based method of Fruchterman and Reingold (1991)
Stress-majorization method of Gansner, Koren, and North (2005)
Hierachical drawing of directed graphs inspired by the methods of Sugiyama, Tagawa, and Toda (1981).

The visualizations are created using Compose.jl, enabling output to a variety of vector and raster image formats. The hierarchical drawing algorithm has multiple components, some of which can use exact algorithms instead of heuristics. To use these components JuMP and a suitable solver should be installed - JuMP will be automatically installed, but a solver will not.
GraphLayouts.jl is not a comprehensive graph visualization option yet, and may never be. Please consider using a more mature library. Some related packages may meet your needs:
* GraphViz.jl - Julia binding to the GraphViz library.
* TikzGraphs.jl - plot graphs using lualatex/tikz.
Examples
If you have it installed you can plot the resulting graph layouts:
