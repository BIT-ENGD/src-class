Announcement
NotesTeX v3.0 was slightly delayed and will be here by the end of October, 2020. v3.0 will include expanded language support, a redesign of mathematical environments (e.g., theorems, definitions, and examples), removal of deprecated features, and support on additional latex engines, such as, but not limited to, xetex. This major overhaul will be pushed out to CTAN by the end of October after beta testing and feedback.
