Dockerfiles for Plesk
Dockerfiles for building Plesk images.
Ready to Use Images
Ready to use images are published at Docker Hub.
Create a container based on published image for evaluation purposes:
docker run -d -p 8880:8880 plesk/plesk

Use Docker host IP address and 8880 port for URL to open it in the browser. The following command can be used in the terminal:
open http://`docker-machine ip`:8880

Default login and password: admin / changeme 
Create a container with typical port mapping:
docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 8880:8880 -p 8443:8443 -p 8447:8447 plesk/plesk

Automatic port mapping can be used to publish all exposed ports to random ports with the high numbers:
docker run -d -P plesk/plesk

How To Build And Test
Here is an example on how to build the image manually:
cd 17.0 ; docker build -t plesk/plesk:17.0 .

Create a container to test the image:
docker run -d -p 8880:8880 plesk/plesk:17.0
