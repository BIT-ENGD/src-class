Some basic dockerfile examples
==============================
Use with Docker http://www.docker.io
To build an image with docker is pretty simple:
cd rethinkdb
docker build -t="rethinkdb" .

Then to run that image and attach to it at the same time:
docker run -i -t rethinkdb

Or to run it in the background
docker run -d rethinkdb
