Named-entity recognition with Finagle
This project is a demonstration of how you can use Finagle to build a service
that will identify names of people, places, and organizations in any text you
throw at it. It's currently a work in progress.
Quick start
You'll need to download the OpenNLP model files before you can run the project
tests or examples:
sh ./download-models.sh
Now when you run ./sbt console from the project root, Scrooge will
generate our Thrift service and client traits, and then it'll
compile them along with the rest of our code and start a Scala console. Paste
the following lines to start a server running locally on port 9090:

Now you can create a client to speak to the server:

This will print the following:
People: Sherlock Holmes
Places: Afghanistan
As we'd expect. We can also attempt to find names in a Spanish document, since
while we didn't preload the Spanish models when we created our service, we did
download them, so the service will be able to load them if asked:

If you need more control over the configuration of the client, you can use the
more explicit ClientBuilder approach:

This should produce the same result, but will fail if the server doesn't respond
within a second.
