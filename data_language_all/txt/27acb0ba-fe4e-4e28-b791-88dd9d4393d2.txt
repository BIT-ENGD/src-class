you can copy or simlink the "media" folder from the parent directory and the HLMS shader library form Ogre's media this location. Under the "media" and "HLMS" name respectively.
you should copy the HLMS library under an "HLMS" subfolder of your execution directory. (so having a path that looks like HLMS/Hlms/{Pbs, Unlit, Common...}) in this folder.
