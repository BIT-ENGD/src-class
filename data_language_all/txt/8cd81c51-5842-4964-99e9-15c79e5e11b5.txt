ubutils
A (poorly named) simple container with some useful utilities.
The original purpose of this was to aid build scripts across different
distributions where you couldn't always be sure about having
availability and uniformity of utilities.
At present poorly maintained and mostly used for testing/validating
container builds.
If you wish to use the container:
sh
docker run -ti quay.io/cw/ubtils /bin/bash
