A rewrite of former PFlow.jl based on DiscreteEvents.jl. Please stay tuned.
Process Flows
Processes in service, manufacturing, development, logistics, hospitals ... differ from common stochastic processes as modeled in queueing theory:
Each item (good, customer, job, patient ...) flowing through such systems has its own characteristics or constraints in terms of

routing: where does it go, in which sequence,
composition: what other items does its processing need,
service times: how long does a process step take,
due times: when has the work to be completed,
cost: how much does it cost,
priority: …

Often then there are typical characteristics for different types of SKUs, orders, products ...
Then there are system constraints like

capacity
variation
capability
reliability

We are interested in throughput, performance, buffer sizes, lead time, cost ...
