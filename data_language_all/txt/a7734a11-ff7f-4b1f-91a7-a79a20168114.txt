coffeelint-advanced-missing-fat-arrows
This is exactly like the coffeelint builtin missing_fat_arrows rule, except you can disable it with a 'use this' directive in the first line of your function.
Install via npm, then configure in coffeelint.json like so:
"advanced_missing_fat_arrows": {
    "module": "coffeelint-advanced-missing-fat-arrows",
    "level": "warn"
}
