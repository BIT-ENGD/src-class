koko (ここ)
sometimes you just need to jot down an idea
you don't want to think about resolutions or DPI...
or about resizing your canvas...
or panning your image about...  
you just want a blackboard that goes on forever
koko is here: the simple, infinite canvas.

disclaimer
this is software is still under initial development. 
at the time of writing: koko can't even save or restore images.
assume nothing works and that everything is broken.
building koko
Koko is written in rust, you will need the following:

a working rust toolchain w/ rustc and cargo
GPU & Drivers supporting OpenGL 3.1 and newer

Once you have that, just clone this project and run:

cargo build to build the executable or...
cargo run to run it

todo
