The 10‚Åπth Emacs configuration on Github (Yes, there are that many Emacs users!)
I have recently started using Emacs and this is my configuration. I decided to put it up here to easily share it across the machines I use - and of course, there can never be too many Emacs configurations on Github. If you stumble upon any bits you like, feel free to copy them.
