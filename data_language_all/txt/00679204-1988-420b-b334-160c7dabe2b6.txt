OTA Image Server
This is an OTA firmware image server for CC2650-based devices running Contiki.  This server is an incredibly simple CoAP server.  It reads the OTA image file ota-image-example.bin, and serves it in chunks using CoAP's blockwise data transfer mechanism.

Please note this server will not automatically work with any .bin file.  You must specifically compile your Contiki app to be an OTA image, with associated metadata (version number, UUID, CRC checksum).

Dependencies
This server is a Node.JS server so you will need the node binary to run it.  For most Debian distros the command to install NodeJS is
bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
For more information on other systems see the NodeJS installation page.
Running
To run the server using the provided ota-image-example firmware, just execute:
bash
node ota-server.js ota-image-example.bin
To serve your own firmware over OTA, simple replace ota-image-example.bin with your own OTA image.
Configuration
The CoAP server can be made to listen using IPv6 or IPv4 by changing the following line in ota-server.js:
js
var server = coap.createServer({ type: 'udp6' });
To use IPv4 hostnames (e.g. 127.0.0.1), just use udp4 in lieu of udp6.
