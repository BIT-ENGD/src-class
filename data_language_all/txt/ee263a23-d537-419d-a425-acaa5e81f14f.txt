Gander
User testing prototypes for Gander, a secure, mobile-friendly way to access and search Microsoft Exchange email.
Organization
Unlike most repositories on Github, the default branch is not master; it is gh-pages. 
Any changes pushed to Github will automatically be available at ripariandata.github.com/Gander
Each user test is contained within a separate folder at the root level and contains an index.html 
file that serves as its root. For example, the start page for test U can be found at /U/index.html and
it can be accessed at ripariandata.github.com/Gander/U
The user tests are static web pages that use Javascript for dynamic content. 
Scripting is managed via coffeescript for complex functionality. 
Shared images, scripts, and stylesheets are contianed in /images, /scripts, and /css, respectively.
Designers: Getting Started
You will need a web browser, a plaintext editor such as Sublime Text, 
and access to a git client ( Windows or Mac ).
In order to compile coffeescript code to javascript, you will also need a coffeescript compiler 
( Mac or Windows ).
Compiling Coffeescript


Windows: Open a console (cmd.exe) and type cd PATH, where PATH is the location of coffee.exe. 
  Press enter to navigate to this directory. Compile a coffeescript file by typing coffee.exe -c FILENAME, 
  where FILENAME includes the path to the file (such as C:\Users\julianc\Desktop\Gander\scripts\verify.coffee). Then press enter. A file called verify.js will be created.


Mac: open a terminal window (termianl.app) and type cd FOLDER, where FOLDER is the location of the coffeescript file you want to compile (for example, ~/Desktop/Gander/scripts).
  Press enter to navigate to this folder. Compile a coffeescript file whenever it is updated by typing coffee -wc FILENAME, where filename is something like verify.js


Running a test Locally on your Computer
Just open one of the index.html files in a browser like Chrome or Safari.
