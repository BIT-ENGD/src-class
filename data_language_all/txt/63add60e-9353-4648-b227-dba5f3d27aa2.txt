Simple Yet Elegant
The PlanR app allows you to easily search for and find destinations and locations - pr drop a pin - using the familiar Apple Maps interface, and to then add those locations, along with a time, to their Itinerary. The Itinerary lists all saved locations, sorted by time, and provides dynamically-generated  directions between locations.
