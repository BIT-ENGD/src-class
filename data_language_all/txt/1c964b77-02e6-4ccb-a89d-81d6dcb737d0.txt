chrome-breakview
A breakpoint viewer for Chrome. Quickly resize to one of your defined breakpoints for testing your responsive web site.
Usage
The is a Page Action extension (icon will be in the address bar). The icon will only show up, if your page has an element with id "chrome-breakpoints" defined that has children for each of your defined breakpoints. For example:
<div id="chrome-breakpoints">
    <input type="hidden" name="small" value="320" />
    <input type="hidden" name="medium" value="640" />
    <input type="hidden" name="large" value="960" />
</div>

When you select the page action, you will be presented with a popup that lets you select which breakpoint you would like to resize to. Selecting a breakpoint will resize the browser window and refresh the page.
I realize that rendering DOM elements for breakpoints is less that ideal. This will be addressed in the near future.
Contributors
You will need node.js and coffeescript to contribute to this project. There is a Cakefile with build and watch tasks which generate the extension file in ./build (ignored by .gitignore). You can then add this folder to Chrome's extensions (in Developer mode) for testing.
For testing purposes, there is a sample_page.html file in the root directory which will trigger the extension.
With that, fork away...looking forward to pull requests!
