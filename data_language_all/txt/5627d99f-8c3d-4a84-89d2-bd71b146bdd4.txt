Sasha bot
Sasha is a chat bot, based in Hubot. She's pretty cool. 
She's extendable with scrips and can work on slack chat 
and other many different chat services.
Slack is a very popular chat service, free and customizable with funny options. However, it has some
limitations witch you can skip getting a no-free account. For more details you can review the 
pricing page.
Prerequisites
Once you have created your new team in Slack, you can get a api bot.
This token is necessary because Sasha needs it for her integration with slack.
Then copy/paste docker-compose.yml.dist and set the new api key here:
cp docker-compose.yml.dist docker-compose.yml
sed -i 's/HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN=${SLACK_TOKEN}/HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN=[SASHA_TOKEN]/g' docker-compose.yml
If you don't have Docker in your system read the get started with Docker and install it.
Starting
Now you can move Sasha to live:
docker-compose up -d 
and talk with her in any channel of your slack team. Write sasha ping and she'll return PONG.
Enjoy!
