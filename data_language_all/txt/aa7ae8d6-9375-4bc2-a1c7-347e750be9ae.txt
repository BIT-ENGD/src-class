Pattern syntax
Pattern consists of ordinary text and tokens that will be replaced during generation
ordinary [token] text
Each token consists of two parts:

wm - Word mode (optional)
ps - Part of Speech

and looks like this: [wm ps],
or this: [ps]
Part of Speech
ps can be one of four supported PoS'es:

verb
adverb
adj or adjective
noun

By default, token will be replaced with random word of selected PoS
ps can also be followed by parentheses that contains a query for word lookup, then token will be replaced with random lookup result
Token examples:
[verb]
[adj(query)]
Word mode
Word in terms of WordNet isn't just a single word, but possibly a group of words or a phrase. Word mode helps to handle situations, where you need exactly one word in place of token.
This is an example phrase, or a WordNet word that will be used to provide examples in mode list below:
golden fairy lantern
So, the actual word modes (wm) list:

First Word fw: golden
Last Word lw: lantern
Random Word rw: any of golden, fairy or lantern
Separator sep(-): golden-fairy-lantern

fw and lw selects first or last word of a phrase accordingly, rw just selects random word from a phrase, and sep replaces space with separator provided in parentheses followed by it
Token examples:
[rw noun]
[lw adverb]
[fw noun(grass)]
[sep(_) noun]
[sep(-) verb]
[sep(::) adj(ironic)]
