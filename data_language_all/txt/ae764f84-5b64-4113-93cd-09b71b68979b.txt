Twilio-IP-Messaging-Plays-Pokemon
A clone of the 2013 phenomenon "Twitch Plays Pokemon" using Twilio's new IP Messaging API. This was inspired by an example from Socket.io but using Twilio to implement the chat instead of raw websockets.
For step by step instructions on how to build this, check out my post on the Twilio blog.
Getting Started
In order to get everything running, first clone the repository. 
From the project's root directory run the following command to install all dependencies:
shell
npm run deps
To run the server:
shell
npm start
There are several environment variables you will have to set before continuing:
shell
export TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="INSERT-ACCOUNT-SID-HERE"
export TWILIO_API_KEY="INSERT-API-KEY-SID-HERE"
export TWILIO_API_SECRET="INSERT-API_SECRET-SID-HERE"
export TWILIO_IPM_SERVICE_SID="INSERT-IPM-SERVICE-SID-HERE"
export WEPLAY_ROM="/path/to/gameboy/rom"
If you are confused for which values to put for these variables, you can read a more thorough explanation in this blog post.
