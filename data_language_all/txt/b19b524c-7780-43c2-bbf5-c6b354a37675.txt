Notes on migrating exhibits from Neatline 2.6.1 instances

The exhibit_type property has been added to exhibits in 3.0 and should be determined as follows:
If the exhibit's spatial_layer value is not null, exhibit_type should be set to 0 (the value corresponding to 'MAP')
If spatial_layer is null and image_layer has a value other than null or an empty string, exhibit_type should be set to 1 (the value corresponding to 'IMAGE')
If spatial_layer is null and image_layer is null or empty but wms_address and/or spatial_layers has a value other than null or an empty string, exhibit_type should be set to 0
If spatial_layer, image_layer, wms_address, and spatial_layers are all null or empty, exhibit_type should be set to -1 (the value corresponding to 'UNDEFINED')


The spatial_layer exhibit property has been updated to use keys from an enumerated set of types, and certain layer types may be deprecated for general-purpose use due to changes in their APIs. As this implementation is still in progress, decisions about how specifically to process this property should be made later on.
