title: Cryptocurrency Market-Making
description: |

This is an algorithmic trading program written in Python 3 that performs market-making trades on decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges.
It seeks to capitalize on the relative volatility of cryptocurrency markets and the limited competition among existing market-makers.
Over the course of this project to date, it has yielded a roughly 8.8% monthly return, averaged over its entire lifespan.
The source is private due to the secretive nature of the project, but further explanation is available on request.
