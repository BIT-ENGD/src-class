Fisher's exact test

Implements a 2×2 Fishers exact test. Use this to test the independence of two
categorical variables when the sample sizes are small.
For an approachable explanation of Fisher's exact test, see
Fisher's exact test of independence by
John H. McDonald in the Handbook of Biological Statistics.
The test is computed using code ported from Øyvind Langsrud's JavaScript
implementation at http://www.langsrud.com/fisher.htm,
