A Rust HTTP Server
This is an incomplete implementation of an HTTP server written in Rust. It can
serve files from a directory as plain text, but that's about it.
Initially, I wanted to write a Web framework as a way to learn Rust, but since
there's no "official" Rust HTTP server yet, I thought I'd try implementing one
and then building my framework on top of that.
But that's a ton of work and there are more mature HTTP projects under way
(such as Teepee), so I probably won't do much more with this.
