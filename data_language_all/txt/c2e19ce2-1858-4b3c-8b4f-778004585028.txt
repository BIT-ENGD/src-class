Instructions for compiling CASTEP 19.11 for ARCHER2 using GCC compilers
These instructions are for compiling CASTEP 19.11 on ARCHER2
using the GCC compilers. ARCHER2 is an HPE Cray EX supercomputer with two AMD 7742 64-core
processors per node and the HPE Cray Slingshot interconnect.
We assume that you have obtained the CASTEP source code from the UKCP developers.
Unpack the CASTEP source code
Unpack the source
bash
tar -xvf CASTEP-19.11.tar.gz
Setup correct modules
Setup the GCC compilers and load the FFTW library module:
bash
module restore PrgEnv-gnu
module swap gcc gcc/9.3.0
module load cray-fftw
Edit the Makefile to set options
Switch to the main CASTEP directory
bash
cd CASTEP-19.11
Edit Makefile and set the following options
COMMS_ARCH := mpi
FFT := fftw3
BUILD := fast
MATHLIBS := scilib
Edit the arch build options to remove static
ARCHER2 does not currently support building applications statically so the option
to set this must be removed from the obj/platforms/linux_x86_64_gfortran9.0-XT.mk
file. Open the file in an editor and remove the -static flag from the LD_FLAGS
variable. After modification, it should look like:
LD_FLAGS = $(OPT) -fopenmp
Build CASTEP
Build CASTEP using the following commands:
bash
unset CPU
CC=cc CASTEP_ARCH=linux_x86_64_gfortran9.0-XT make -j8  clean
CC=cc CASTEP_ARCH=linux_x86_64_gfortran9.0-XT make -j8
The install process will ask for the path to the BLAS and LAPACK libraries - just
leave this blank as the compiler wrapper scripts automatically deal with this.
You will also be asked for the path to FFTW; just leave this blank as the compiler 
wrapper scripts automatically deal with this.
Install CASTEP
To install the binaries in a specified directory use:
bash
make -j8 INSTALL_DIR=/work/t01/t01/auser/software/CASTEP/19.11-gcc/bin install
If you wish to simply install into the bin/ directory in the CASTEP source
tree you can simply use:
bash
make -j8 install
The built binary is called castep.mpi.
