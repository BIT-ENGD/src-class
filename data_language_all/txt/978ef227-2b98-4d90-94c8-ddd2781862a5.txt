Many scientific papers start out by showing a location map of the region
of interest. This map will typically also contain certain features and
labels. This example will present a location map for the equatorial
Atlantic ocean, where fracture zones and mid-ocean ridge segments have
been plotted. We also would like to plot earthquake locations and
available isochrons. We have obtained one file, quakes.xym, which contains the
position and magnitude of available earthquakes in the region. We choose
to use magnitude/100 for the symbol-size in inches. The digital fracture
zone traces (fz.xy) and isochrons (0 isochron as ridge.xy, the rest as isochrons.xy) were
digitized from available maps. We create the final location map
with the following script:
{% highlight bash %}
{% include {{page.script}} %}
{% endhighlight %}
The same figure could equally well be made in color, which could be
rasterized and made into a slide for a meeting presentation. The script
is similar to the one outlined above, except we would choose a color for
land and oceans, and select colored symbols and pens rather than black
and white.
