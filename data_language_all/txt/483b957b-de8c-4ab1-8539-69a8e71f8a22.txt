Manipulation Package for BetaGo
This is manipulation packages for BetaGo.
Usage
Only Moveit!
asm
roslaunch betago_moveit_config demo.launch
The node graph:

Moveit! with Gazebo
asm
roslaunch betago_bringup betago_bringup_moveit.launch
roslaunch betago_moveit_config moveit_rviz.launch

The difference is Only Moveit! will create a fake joint state controller and a joint_state_publisher to publish /joint_states while in "Moveit + Gazebo", the real jointStateController will publish the /joint_states. 
args of betago_bringup_moveit.launch:
- dual_arm:=(default:true/false) : single-arm controller or dual-arm controller
Step to construct the package for moveit+gazebo

use moveit setup_assistant to construct the initial package.








create ridgeback_world.launch


this launch file is mainly used to find empty.launch,load robot_description and call urdf_spawner

create betago_states_gazebo.launch


this launch file is mainly used to load joint_state_controller.yaml,call joint_controller_spawner to start joint_state_controller and call robot_state_publisher to publish tf.

joint_state_controller.yaml


This controller is used to monitor the state of the robot and set the publish rate to 50.

create arm_trajectory_controller.launch


this launch is mainly used to load arm_controller.yaml and call arm_controller_spawner to start JointTrajectoryController

arm_controller.yaml



set the controller name: dual_ur_arm_controller,left_ur_arm_controller and right_ur_arm_controller, type: effort_controllers/JointTrajectoryController 
set the joint list, constraints and pid gains.

copy the betago_moveit_planning_executation.launch to betago_moveit_config/launch and change the content to suit your model.


This launch file is mainly used to start move_group.launch ,moveit_rivz.launch.
move_group.launch can start node move_group and trajectory_execution.launchwhich is used to find ridgeback_moveit_controller_manager.launch.xml.

copy the content in the launch/ridgeback_moveit_controller_manager.launch.xml to the same file in your package.


This launch file is mainly used to find controllers.yaml

copy the controllers.yaml to betago_moveit_config/config and change the content to suit your model.


In name tag, enter the controller you set in arm_controller.yaml.
action_ns and type tag are mainly used to start follow joint trajectoryï¼Œwhich is used to connect gazebo and rivz.

create betago_bringup_moveit.launch


this launch file is mainly used to find ridgeback_world.launch, betago_states_gazebo.launch, arm_trajectory_controller.launch and betago_moveit_planning_executation.launch.


everytime you run setup assistant to modify the model config, some files don't need to be overwritten.


confg :

controller.yaml: this is used to replace the ros_controller.yaml, everytime you add or delete the joint need to be drive, add or delete the corresponding config in the controller.yaml.
ompl_planning.yaml: this is used to set planner.



launch:

moveit.rviz
moveit_rviz.launch generally dose not need to be overwritten.
ridgeback_moveit_controller_manager.launch.xml
demo.launch generally dose not need to be overwritten.
