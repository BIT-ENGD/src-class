rivlib-rs
Use Riegl's RiVLib via Rust.
Note: This software was not developed by Riegl.
Please do not contact Riegl for support related to this software.
To use, you'll need to have RiVLib installed somewhere on your library search path, e.g. /usr/local/lib.
You'll also need the headers installed to somewhere on your include file search path, e.g. /usr/local/include.
Sub-crates
Underneath the rivlib Rust lib, there are two sub-crates:

scanifc-sys uses bindgen to build Rust bindings to RiVLib's C interface, scanifc.
scanlib uses a custom C++ wrapper to expose functionality from RiVLib's C++ interface, scanlib.
  This C++ wrapper must be compiled on your machine when you're building the rivlib crate.
