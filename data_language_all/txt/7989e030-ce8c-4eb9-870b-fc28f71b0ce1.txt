Resume, be Template
When I am not too busy, say, in-between jobs, I like to keep my programming sharp by automating things.
This is one of them.
How does this work?
The resume data lives in resume.yaml which is then processed by the python script render_jinja.py using the Jinja2 templates.
To build all the templates, simply type make all or the files of choice; resume.pdf, resume.html, or resume.txt
Prerequisites:

Jinja2 pip install jinja
Latex (for the tex/ps/pdf files)
