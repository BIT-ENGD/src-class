
Running hubot via Docker
You can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not
behave as expected unless the environment variables they rely
upon have been set.
You can start hubot by running:
% docker run -it --rm  --env-file ${env-file} -v ${repo-dir}/scripts:/hubot/scripts ${image-id/tag} /hubot/bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output and a prompt:
[Sat Feb 28 2015 12:38:27 GMT+0000 (GMT)] INFO firebase-brain: Connecting to Firebase brain
hubot>

Then you can interact with hubot by typing hubot help.
hubot> hubot help
hubot animate me <query> - The same thing as `image me`, except adds [snip]
hubot help - Displays all of the help commands that hubot knows about.
