Open the terminal in this directory then enter the following commands in the terminal:
 - Configuring a remote for fork
   $ git remote -v 
   //Lists the current configured remote repository for your fork//
   $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/Purukitto/Yuso_TravelApp.git
   //Specifies a new remote upstream repository that will be synced with the fork//
   $ git remote -v
   //Should show the newly made remote *upstream* along with your previous remote//



Syncing the fork
$ git fetch upstream
   //Fetch the branches and their respective commits from the upstream repository//
   $ git checkout master
   //Switches to local master branch//
   $ git merge upstream/master
   //Merges the upstearm remote (Main repo) into your local fork//
