Store
Simple Key/Value store for use on the command line
Nothing much to it. Just needs sqlite3 (assumes it's in /usr/bin). Everything else is just plain old bash.
You can use .store.rc to have the built in cd look in store first.
See the usage for more information.
Rename store.sh to just store for easier use (just named that way so GitHub shows proper syntax)
