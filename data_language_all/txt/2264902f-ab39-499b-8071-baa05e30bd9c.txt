OpenRoads Vietnam Analytics
Running locally
Environment setup
To set up the development environment for this website, you'll need to install the following on your system:

Node, see version in .nvmrc file
yarn

After these basic requirements are met, install dependencies by running yarn install.
By default, the local deployment will use the production API. If you run a local instance of the API (using repo orma/openroads-vn-api), then you can change the api value in this repo's configuration files (app/assets/scripts/config/*).
Getting started
yarn run serve compiles the sass files, javascript, and launches the server making the site available at http://localhost:3000/. The system will watch files and execute tasks whenever one of them changes. The site will automatically refresh since it is bundled with livereload.
Building for deployment
Run yarn run build to compile all site resources into a dist folder. This folder can be deployed on a remote host, and act as the full production website.
Continuous integration
A CI server takes care of deployment to production; any merge to the master branch will deploy.
Architecture

(This architecture diagram is also available on Google Drawings.)
Website user guide
A bi-lingual user guide is available for the front-end of the ORMA platform; for now, please request it from Duc Cong Phan dphan2@worldbank.org. In the future it will be available within this repo.
Processes
Internationalization
Managing translations with transifex
Vietnamese - English translations are managed with transifex's tx cli and the app/assets/locales/source/en.json and app/assets/locales/vn.json files
To add new words to translate:

Add a new key/val pair in the source en.json file where key/val are equal and save the file.

...
'Roads': 'Roads',
...

Pull then push Push the update en.json file to transifex using the tx cli

$ tx pull && tx push -s
the reason to pull then push is so that translations on transifex aren't overwritten (the behavior of tx push) 

pull the new changes using tx pull once translations are complete on transifex

note that step 2 is built into the current circleci build, so you should not have to follow these steps explicitly so long as you push changes to github
Setting up transifex
to install tx run pip install transifex-client
then add a .transifexrc in the root of the repo following the below configuration

note don't quote values in the .transifexrc
Managing translators && approving translations on transifex's website
in addition to adding and pulling new translations into the site, so too will translations need to be approved using the transifex web editor. Documentation on how to do so is here.
Also, if a manager needs to add new translators, here is the documentation, and if a new translator needs guidance for translating, here is the documentation
