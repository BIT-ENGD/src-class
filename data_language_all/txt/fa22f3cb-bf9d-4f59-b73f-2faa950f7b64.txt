SONIC OPEN KANG PROJECT
SONIC OPEN KANG PROJECT platform manifest
Getting Started
To get started with the SONIC OPEN KANG PROJECT sources, you'll need to get
familiar with Git and Repo.
Create the Directories
You will need to set up some directories in your build environment.
To create them run:
mkdir -p ~/bin
mkdir -p ~/SOKP

Install the Repository
Enter the following to download the "repo" binary and make it executable:
curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo && chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
You may need to reboot for these changes to take effect. 
Now enter the following to initialize the repository:
cd ~/SOKP

Repositories:
Before you continue --> run this in the terminal
repo init -u git://github.com/SOKP/android.git -b sokp-kk

&&

repo sync -f

PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU MUST USE THE -f flag when repo syncing/initializing if you want to sync with our default -j4 setup as android.googlesource seems to like to reject your requests if you set your -jflag too high. 
if you wish to avoid this issue run it repo sync -j1 otherwise -f (force) is recommended so it will resync the repos it gets error codes on. Thank you and have a nice day.
Building the System
Initialize the environment with the envsetup.sh script. Note that replacing "source" with a single dot saves a few characters, and the short form is more commonly used in documentation.
. build/envsetup.sh
brunch n7100 ( Replace n7100 with your device name if you are building for other devices )

You can also build (and see how long it took) for specific devices like this:
Build the Code:
. build/envsetup.sh
time brunch n7100 ( Replace n7100 with your device name if you are building for other devices )

Submitting Patches
