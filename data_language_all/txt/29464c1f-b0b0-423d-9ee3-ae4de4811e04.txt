web-marty-universal-base

Driftt's universal web application base built on the following technologies

Marty (Flux implementation with client side state hydration)
Isomorphic/Universal rendering
React
React Router
Express
Coffeescript (for development speed & NO JSX)
Webpack for bundling
Webpack Dev Server (serves hot updates)
Stylus with Nib

Installation
Install packages and gulp-cli (if not installed):
$ npm install
$ npm install --global gulp

Development Build and Server with Hot Reload
This setup runs a hot reloaded express server serving server-side rendered pages in addition to a web-pack development server which hot-swaps code with the client as you code.
$ gulp
go to http://localhost:8003/ for real time hot reload

Creating a New Page Component

create a react component under src/scripts/components for the new page see Viewer on how to create a component
implement a new react route for the component in src/scripts/routes.coffee

NewPage = require('components/NewPage')
    ...
    component Route, {
      name: 'newPage'
      path: 'newPage'
      handler: createAsyncHandler(NewPage)
    }

give yourself a good pat on the back
