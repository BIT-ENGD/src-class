Snippets for Ruby Mode
About
Comprehensive collection of Ruby snippets for
yasnippet.
The collection also contains snippets for major Ruby frameworks like Rails
and RSpec.
The Rails snippets were originally borrowed from
mknittig/yasnippet-rails.
The RSpec snippets require that RSpec files are edited in a separate
Emacs mode. I recommend using
rspec-mode.el.
The RSpec snippets were originally borrowed from
gary/yasnippets-rspec.

And much of the credits should naturally go to the yasnippet-rails and
yasnippet-rspec authors.
