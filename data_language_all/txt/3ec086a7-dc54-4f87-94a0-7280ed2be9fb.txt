Introduction
All visualization utils and applications associated with the Caesar and RoME projects are collected here.  This package offers a variety 3D visualization utilities for understanding the state estimation, localization, and mapping aspects associated with mobile platform navigation.  This package was developed for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) using the Caesar.jl framework.  Please see RoMEPlotting.jl for 2D visualization utils.  
This package is built in the Julia or (JuliaPro) programming language.  Comments and issues are welcome, and note that this package should see several changes and evolutions during 2019.
Installation
We are transitioning to MeshCat.jl, .
This is registed with Julia METADATA but please use current master branch.

julia> ] # activate pkg manager
(v1.0) pkg> add Arena#master
Notice
Arena has the ability to request cloud server information for visualization but will never send or start receiving any information unless the user explicitly requests authentication from the GraffSDK.jl servers.
