Integration
There are three pieces of code you need to add to your web page.
HTML Element
<div id="fling_uploader"></div>

Put this in your page's HTML where you'd like it to show up.
Script
<script src="http://source/assets/uploader.js"></script>

Config
<script type="text/javascript">
  fling.config.announce = "http://localhost:9050/announce"
  fling.config.session_id = "identify_this_user_uploads"
</script>

When an upload is complete, you'll be notified of it at the url you set
fling.config.announce to.
Server
After a user's fully uploaded their file, you will be notified at the location
you've configured. This request will be a list of URLs that you can download
from.
