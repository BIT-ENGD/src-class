TinySegmenter

TinySegmenter.jl is a Julia version of TinySegmenter, which is an extremely compact Japanese tokenizer
originally written in JavaScript by Mr. Taku Kudo.
Usage

The return value of tokenize is an array of substrings of the string input,
giving the locations of the tokens in the text.  (Substrings are represented
by the SubString Julia type.)
Benchmarks
The following are times in seconds for a benchmark (see benchmark/README.md) of TinySegmenter
implementations in different languages tokenizing a large (243kB) Japanese text:
|Ruby | C++ | Perl | JavaScript(Node.js) | Go | Python | Julia |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|132.98 | 48 | 134 |105.31 | 10.50 | 111.85 | 11.70 |
The benchmark was performed on the following machine:

Intel Core i5-3210M CPU at 2.50GHz
8GB RAM (1600MHz DDR3)
MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2012), MacOS 10.11 ("El Capitan")

The benchmark text was The Time Machine by H.G. Wells, translated to Japanese by Hiroo Yamagata under the CC BY-SA 2.0 License.   We also use the same text for validation (in the test directory).
