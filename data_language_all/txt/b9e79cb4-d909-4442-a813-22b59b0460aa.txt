mux

Like tmux but without the t

mux is a terminal command multiplexer.  It tries to be compatible with xargs; it accepts the same flags and syntax.
The big difference is that mux runs all commands in parallel, in separate pseudo-terminals.  As such, it can be used to
replace tools such as cluster-ssh and tmux for the use-case where you want to run lots of commands in parallel and give
them the same input.
mux was written for my personal use in my free time, and as such there is not a super huge focus on code quality or testing.
The tool is pragmatic and tries to cover common use-cases.

Installation
Install Rust, then:
$ rustup toolchain add nightly-2019-03-11
$ cargo +nightly-2019-03-11 install --git https://github.com/dflemstr/mux.git
Make sure that ~/.cargo/bin is in your PATH (rustup usually sets this up automatically).
Simple usage
Running echo '1 2 3' | mux command arg1 arg2 will start command arg1 arg2 1, command arg1 arg2 2 and command arg1 arg2 3
in parallel.
You use Ctrl+T to exit the GUI that pops up.
See mux --help for more info.
