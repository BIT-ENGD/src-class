Fling
to understand: clone, cd into repo, ./fling

Fling is a command launcher.
The point of Fling is to help you straighten out that heap of miscellaneous helper scripts stacking up in your project -- admit it, they exist and their numbers have been growing -- into something navigable and tab-complete'able.
Plug in anything (any kind of command, any binary, any language) and get subcommands, help text, and bash autocompletion support -- just by symlinking the command into the fling config dir.
Any time you would have reached for make (but don't really want to put up with ".PHONY" declarations and other last-century bullshit) or rake (but don't want to deal with the whole ruby ecosystem), reach for Fling instead.
It's pure eyewatering-but-portable bash.
Any time you would have written a "small" bash script, then watched it inevitably turn into a massive, terrifying case-switch monstrosity that now needs its own help and usage manuals... reach for Fling instead.
Fling is replacing that case-and-"do what I mean" with a scripts.d that you can navigate easily.
Fling also is that help and usage generator you always known you needed but could never get around to.
