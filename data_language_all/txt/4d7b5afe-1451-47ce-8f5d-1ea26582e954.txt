This package provides access to the Vega-Lite high-level visualization grammar (http://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) from Julia.
Vega-Lite is a simpler version of the Vega grammar allowing smaller and more expressive chart specifications. Vega-Lite is intentionaly more limited than Vega, if you need a finer control over the produced graph you can turn instead to the Vega.jl package (https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/Vega.jl). Parts of the VegaLite package (rendering functions, IJulia integration) are based on Vega.jl (thanks !).
Install with Pkg.add("VegaLite") (or Pkg.clone("https://github.com/fredo-dedup/VegaLite.jl.git")
until it reaches the official repository). Most functions are documented, with the full list of their properties listed and explained, e.g. type ? config_mark to get the full list of properties of the config_mark function, etc.
The julia functions follow pretty closely the Vega-Lite JSON format: data_values() creates the {"data": {values: { ...} }} part of the spec file, etc.
Only two functions are added:
- svg(Bool) : sets the drawing mode of the plots, SVG if true, canvas if false. Default = true
- buttons(Bool) : indicates if the plot should be accompanied with links 'Save as PNG', 'View source' and 'Open in Vega Editor'. Default = true.
Currently, VegaLite.jl works with IJulia/Jupyter, Escher and in the standard REPL (a browser window will open).
