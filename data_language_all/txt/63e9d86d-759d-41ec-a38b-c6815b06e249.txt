The bootstrap script for working with JavaScript and NodeJS in BDD/TDD ways.
Basic Usage

Run the initial npm command

shell
cd ~/codes
git clone git@github.com:agilecreativity/jsbdd-bootstrap.git
cd ~/codes/jssbdd-bootstrap
npm install
Misc Tips
Since I am using the nodenv I usually run the following command first just to
make sure that I have everything setup to use the right version.

I want to make sure that I use the latest version of node
shell
$nodenv --versions
Which gives
shell
v0.10
v0.10.28
v0.10.31
v0.10.37
v0.12
v0.12.0
v0.12.2
v0.6
v0.6.20
v0.8
v0.8.26
To install the latest version of node

The will generate the package.json which we can use to manage the dependency
for the project. This will generate the package.json file
shell
$npm install mocha chai sinon sinon-chai coffee-script --save-dev

Create the proper .gitignore file for the project

Tips I am using the command line that generated using gitignore.io
e.g. gi service to create ignore file for a particular project type.
e.g. gi node > .gitignore which will produce the content like this


Now install the npm modules for our testing

npm install chai sinon sinon-chai mocha --save-dev

Now we need to generate the package.json using the npm init command

Once the setup is done we can
shell
npm run-script watch
