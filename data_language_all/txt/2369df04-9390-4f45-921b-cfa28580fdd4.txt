Assembly (Round 1, ADL)
Domain Description
The goal is to assemble a complex object made out of subassemblies.
The sequence of steps must obey a given partial order.
In addition, through poor engineering design, many subassemblies must be installed temporarily in one assembly, then removed and given a permanent home in another.

Additional Notes
There are two slight different versions of the domain (version 1, version 2).
As it is unclear which version is considered official, version 1 was selected because it is closer to modern PDDL.
Some instances have received bug fixes between the publication of the original instance archive and the revised one (this concerns instances 7, 12, 13, 14, 19, and 27).
The corrected instances are included here.
The original instances can be found in the additional notes directory for reference.
