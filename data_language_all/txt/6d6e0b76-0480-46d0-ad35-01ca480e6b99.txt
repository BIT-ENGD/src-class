 MEAN Admin

Admin module for MEAN applications to manage:

Modules list
Bootswatch themes support
App Settings
User Management

Basic Usage
Install Package in root of your mean app:
$ mean install mean-admin

Add the admin role to your user:
$ mean user <email> -a admin

(Re)start the server:
$ grunt

Deployment
In order to deploy mean-admin to Heroku or otherwise, add the following line to package.json of the mean app:
"mean-admin": "linnovate/mean-admin",

Note: the mean-admin pubilshed on npm does not work with meanio. The line above will pull the module directly from GitHub.
Don't forget to add the admin role to the admin user. Make sure server/config/env/production.js is updated with the production db url, then use the --env flag as:
$ mean user <email> -a admin --env production
