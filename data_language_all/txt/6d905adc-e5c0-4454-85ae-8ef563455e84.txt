NanoTest

NanoTest is a pipelined testing framework that attempts to integrate
a broad spectrum of testing facilities for software development in Julia.
This package is currently in development.
The final release will provide:

Extendable API and configuration (plugin-oriented architecture)
Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)
Parallel test execution
Markdown example code runner
Code coverage thresholding
Code style thresholding (e.g. lint)
Code analysis thresholding (e.g. function code complexity)
Benchmark thresholding (e.g. estimated asymptotic complexity, relative timings)
Fixtures (e.g. mocks/stubs/spies)
Stochastic software testing
Specification based random testing (e.g. QuickCheck in Haskell)
