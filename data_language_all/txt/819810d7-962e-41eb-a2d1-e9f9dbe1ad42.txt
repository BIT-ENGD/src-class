Use d3.js to visualize traffic through haproxy
Usage:
npm install
grunt build
cat haproxy_sample.log | grep -v 127.0.0.1 | grep doc | coffee filters/haproxy.coffee | coffee app/server/index.coffee
Make sure to add in some greps to filter the raw haproxy log, otherwise you're going to get a LOT of data.
Change the visualization format with the query string. For example:
http://localhost:8000/?layout=columns&group1=/
Will group nodes into columns, with the second group (indexed from 0, so specified by group1)
made up of all nodes which match the regex '/'. Any regexs can be passed as options to groupX.
Available layout options: row, column, circular (default if nothing else specified).
