This is the README for the ICS 491 'Step-by-Step Mathematics' project.
The project has now reached its final form, that of a secure learning application.
Contributions:
Basic program (non-security functions):
Jarrod Lofy & Team from another class
Implementation of Security functions (login, user account):
Jarrod Lofy (lead)
Alexandra Minc-Flacco (editing, comments)
Report Writing:
Spencer Luther (lead)

Security Analysis:
Spencer Luther (testing, unsafe function review)

For a color scheme it may be best to stick to two colors (one highlight, one for text). 
Some possible suggestions would be:
Yellow & Green (Gender neutral) - #ffc400 #00e676   - 225/255 196/255 0/255   0/255 230/255 118/255
Yellow & Blue - #ffc400 #00bfa5   - 225/255 196/255 0/255   0/255 191/255 165/255
Jarrod - I'll try out both today and see which I like better
One other idea could be if we decided to have a background  of some sort. In that case each lesson could have a different color bg.
The background would be either a color block or a simple subtle pattern (however I would need a size to make the bg image --(iPad Air - 1536 x 2048) ).
Text would be black (or a dark grey #404040) but the highlight would stay the same for consistency (probably yellow).
Then the backgrounds would be #00e676 #00bfa5 #ff5a52 (green blue pink).
