Frontend Technology Stack
Example of a recommended frontend tech stack:

Languages
TypeScript:
    superset of JavaScript with types
Less: CSS preprocessor
Libraries

Redux: state library based on Flux
Test tools
Karma: test runner
Mocha: test framework
Istanbul: code coverage
Build tools
npm scripts
      (along with npm-run-all): build scripts
webpack: module bundler

Directory Structure

build/: compiled files and copied assets (ignored by git)
build/min/: output from production builds
build/src/: output from development builds
src/: source files
test/: test files
test/tsconfig.json: TypeScript compiler configuration for tests
test/typings/: typings for tests
package.json: dependencies and build scripts
tsconfig.json: TypeScript compiler configuration for source files
typings/: typings for source files

Build Tasks
The following tasks should be defined in the scriptsblock inpackage.json`:

npm run clean: delete all files in build/

Compilation

npm run buildDev: build source files for development
npm run build: build source files for production
npm run watch: build source files for development and rebuild on file changes

App Testing

npm test: build and run tests once
npm run tdd: build and run tests continuously

Style Checking

CSS/Less:   stylelint
JavaScript: eslint
TypeScript: tslint
