emacs
See the GNUmakefile in .emacs.d/lisp for a list of make targets to
fetch and install various packages.  The following two steps are all that
should be necessary:

make -C .emacs.d/lisp update
make -C .emacs.d compile

Many of the emacs packages don't compile, but certainly enough do that it
makes a big performance benefit.
