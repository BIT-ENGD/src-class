node-resolve-lua


Implements node's require.resolve module resolution pattern for Lua.
This allows you to install Lua packages from npm and require them like normal modules.
All of the features of npm will come with using this pattern.

Semantic Versioning of modules
Modules installed locally, not globally
Manage installed modules in a package.json file
npm scripts
Tons more

Usage
npm uses this pattern when it installs modules. So let's use npm! installing npm
In your project directory, we need to install node-resolve-lua:
sh
$ npm install node-resolve-lua
lua
--Only needs to be done once
require("./node_modules/node-resolve-lua/node-resolve")
And that's it! You're ready to include modules from npm now.
Example Usage
If we wanted to use a module from npm such as luadash, we would do this:
sh
$ npm install luadash
