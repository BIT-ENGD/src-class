docker-client-swift



A lightweight Swift client for the Docker Remote API.
Get Started
Since docker-client-swift depends on curl  (7.40.0 and higher), make sure it is available on the system.
Mac OS X already includes a version of curl, on Linux you'll have to install it through a system package manager.
For example on Ubuntu: apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
Usage
```Swift
// Create a client instance, optionally specifying the unix socket
let docker = DockerClient(unixSocketPath: "/var/run/docker.sock")
// Create an URLRequest
let url = URL(string: "http:/v1.32/containers/json")!
let request = URLRequest(url: url)
let result = try docker.respond(to: request)
print(result.statusCode)
// => 200
print(String(data: result.headers!, encoding: .utf8))
// => HTTP/1.1 200 OK Cache-Control: private ...
print(String(bytes: result.body!, encoding: .utf8))
// => { "Hostname": "", "Domainname": "", "User": "", ...
