QA Reports Export daemon
This "daemon" fetches reports from QA Reports and uploads them to QA Dashboard. It will check the latest updated date of reports from QA Dashboard and use that as begin time. The initial execution does not have such information and will fetch all bugs in batches.
Configuration
Daemon is configured in config.json and has the following options:

reports:
url: Base URL to QA Reports
basicAuth: HTTP Basic Authentication settings
proxy: HTTP proxy server
fetchCount: How many reports are fetched in a single query? Notice: if you have been performing mass updates or just happen to have large amounts of reports with the exactly same updated_at date this number needs to be large enough to include all those reports in one query -- the next query will fetch bugs updated a second later and will thus miss those with the same updated_at date
updateInterval: How often to poll for reports (in hours)


dashboard:
url: Base URL to QA Dashboard
token: Authentication token (from /user/token URI in QA Dashboard)
basicAuth: Same as in reports
proxy: Same as in reports

Execute
To execute manually run:

npm install
npm start

TODO

Upstart configuration generation, config file symlinking, etc. when deployed.
