OVERVIEW
fomus is a software application for formatting musical output written
by David Psenicka (see: http://fomus.sourceforge.net).
This repository is a package derived from the common lisp port of
fomus with some small modifications due to lilypond api changes and
some enhancements for my personal use.
(c) of the modifications by Orm Finnendahl 2016, released under the
LLGPL v2.0 (like the original code of David Psenicka), see file
LICENSE, no warranties whatsoever.
