This ROS package has several main functions:

It defines two models: a simple 4-link tricycle model and a more complicated rickshaw model
Both models are ready to be simulated in Gazebo
Both model expose APIs and can be controlled by sending commands to /cmd_vel topic
Visualization is done in RVIZ

Usage

roslaunch roboy_models gaz_rickshaw.launch 
roslaunch roboy_navigation nav_static.launch

Note: commands should be executed in the order specified. 
After that you can control the model in RVIZ by selecting 2D Nav Goal  in the toolbar and placing it to the desired location on the map. 
Visualization
You can also use this package to only visualize the model, without running the simulation. To do so run:
roslaunch roboy_models display.launch
