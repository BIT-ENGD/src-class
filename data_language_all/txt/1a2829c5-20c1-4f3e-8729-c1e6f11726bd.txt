Data definition
The database was download from (on 6.12.2018T8:00):
https://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/index.aspx
The NTSB aviation accident database contains information from 1962 and later 
about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents within the United States, 
its territories and possessions, and in international waters. 
What/where/when
What
accident = defined precisely http://www.iprr.org/manuals/Annex13.html
incident = less serious
https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/14074/what-is-the-difference-between-aviation-accident-and-incident
Where = within the United States, its territories and possessions, 
and in international waters
Not clear what does it precisely mean (within US?)
Moreover 

So we define our set: which occured in US (thus excluding outbound
international flights and those crashed over ocean)
awkF '$6 == "United States" {print $6}' AviationData.csv > AviationData_US.csv
When
The file is dynamic and grows every day.  The first observation is
1948

Record is divided into FIELDs and the separation character is |
I want to change '|' into ';'
First I need to check if there are ';' present
grep ';' AviationData.csv

There are four ; and they need to be replaced with some other character
before  substituting '|' to ';'

I rename the file to AviationData.csv

Check if crash site coordinates are always provided:
awkF '$7 == "" {print $7}' AviationData.csv  | wc -l
53894
How many occured in USA:
awkF '$6 == "United States" {print $6}' AviationData.csv | wc -l
77487
How many resulted in more than 100 fatalInjuries
awkF '$24 > 100 {print $24}' AviationData.csv | wc -l
61
How many resulted in at least one fatalInjury
awkF '$24 > 0 {print $24}' AviationData.csv | wc -l
16586
We create two files:AvData_USA_All.csv and AvData_USA_Fatal.csv
wc -l AvData*
      66 AvData.Readme
   77488 AvData_USA_All.csv
   14227 AvData_USA_Fatal.csv

Our further analysis concerns AvData_USA_Fatal.csv

time coverage:

Data starts from  1982 with just a few records 
from older accidents
awkF 'NR > 1 {split ($4, d, /\//); t=d[3] " " d[1] " " d[2] " 0 0 0"; if (d[3] > 1981) {print $0 ";" d[3] ";"d[1] ";
"d[2] }}' AvData_USA_Fatal.csv  > AvData_USA_1982A.csv
We limit our analysis further (when = 1982 and earlier)
awkF '$24 > 0 && $6 == "United States" {print $24}' AvData_USA_1982A.csv > AvData_USA_1982F.csv
