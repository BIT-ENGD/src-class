built_bloc_generator
Generate the BLoC pattern boilerplate.
Quickstart
In order to generate your bloc, your class must extend Bloc, be annotated with @bloc and with a mixin named _<class name>.
Then declare your subject fields  and annotate them with @stream or @sink to generate a public getter accordingly. 
You can also subscribe to a subject with the Bind annotation.

This ExampleBloc will expose your streams and sinks.

How to use
Install
There are a few separate packages you need to install:

Custom names
To control how sink and stream getters are generated you can specify names by using @BlocStream("custom") / @BlocSink("custom") instead of @stream/@sink.
Both Sink and Stream
If you want that a subject to be both exported sa Sink and Stream, you can add two annotations on a unique property.
By default, you sink will be renamed update<name>.
Run the generator
To run the generator, you must use build_runner cli:
sh
flutter pub pub run build_runner watch
