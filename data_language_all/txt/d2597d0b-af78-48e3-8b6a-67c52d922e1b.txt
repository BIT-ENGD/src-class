How to use


Download the latest release from

  OSX:

Extract the "CIV6UI" folder to the DLC folder

Visit https://github.com/Tfifa/CIV6UI occasionally  to be the first to know about new releases and feature additions!


NOTE: Until this mod is in a less experimental state, the mod will not remember its "enabled" status after restarting the game. This means that every time you plan to start a new game using CIV6UI, you'll need to explicitly enable it in the "Additional Content" menu first. Once you've created the game using the mod, it will always load when you start the save, regardless of its current status in the "Additional Content Menu"
