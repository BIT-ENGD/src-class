Dependencies
Package | Requested by | Reasons of choice
--- | --- | ---
curl | imap, mpd, and weather widgets | 1. faster and simpler to use than LuaSocket; 2. it's in the core of almost every distro; 3. can be called asynchronously
GLib >= 2.54 | fs widget | Pure Awesome/Lua implementation.
The second dependency will be removed once all major distros update their Gio/Glib versions.
