This is the project repo for the final project of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree: Programming a Real Self-Driving Car. For more information about the project, see the project introduction here.
Please use one of the two installation options, either native or docker installation.
Native Installation

Be sure that your workstation is running Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus or Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahir. Ubuntu downloads can be found here.
If using a Virtual Machine to install Ubuntu, use the following configuration as minimum:
2 CPU
2 GB system memory
25 GB of free hard drive space

The Udacity provided virtual machine has ROS and Dataspeed DBW already installed, so you can skip the next two steps if you are using this.

Follow these instructions to install ROS
ROS Kinetic if you have Ubuntu 16.04.
ROS Indigo if you have Ubuntu 14.04.
Dataspeed DBW
Use this option to install the SDK on a workstation that already has ROS installed: One Line SDK Install (binary)
