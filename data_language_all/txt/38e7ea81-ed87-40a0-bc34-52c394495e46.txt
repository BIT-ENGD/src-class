Gansa Documentation
This is the source code for the Gansa documentation. Gansa is a simple static site generator.
This documentation is itself a Gansa project, and requires Gansa in order to be compiled.
The compiled form of this documentation will tell you how to install Gansa. You can find the compiled version here: http://cosstropolis.com/gansa
If for some reason you cannot access the compiled documentation, you can find installation instructions for Gansa in src/pages/installation.md.
Compile
From the command line:
gansa build
This will create a directory called "distribute", where the compiled site will be rendered.
