LING


Wikipedia: -ling, an English diminutive suffix
Erlang on Xen
Quick Start
The easy way is to use pre-built railing utility:


Grab a binary named railing-<version> from releases.


Rename the binary to railing and move it to your Erlang project directory.


Create the image and the domain configuration file:
./railing image



Boot the Xen domain and get the familiar Erlang shell:
xl create -c domain_config



How to build/hack LING?
See HACKING.md.
Using railing
Run railing without options to get help.
To generate the image and the domain configuration file use the image
subcommand:
./railing image

This instructs railing to scan all subdirectories for *.beam files. All files
found are embedded into the Xen image and become accessible during runtime.
Certain subdirectories can be excluded from the search using -x option.
