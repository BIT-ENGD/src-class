DataProcessingHierarchyTools


Tools to facilitate processing and visualization of data organized in a hierarchy
Example 1
Query the name associated with a particular level
julia
  using DataProcessingHierarchyTools
  const DPHT = DataProcessingHierarchyTools
  subject_name = DPHT.get_level_name("days","newWorkingMemory/Pancake/20130923/")
  session_name = subject_name = DPHT.get_level_name("day","newWorkingMemory/Pancake/20130923/")
Example 2
Get the necessary relative path change to get from one level to another
julia
using DataProcessingHierarchyTools
const DPHT = DataProcessingHierarchyTools
pth = DPHT.process_level("session", "Pancake/20130923/session01/array01/channel001")
Example 3
For a new data to work with the DataProcessingHierarchyTools API, its definition needs to follow a certain patter. First, it should have a field args which should be a subtype of DataProcessingHierarchyTools.DPHDataArgs. This type should have a field consisting of simple types, i.e. scalars, strings and arrays.
