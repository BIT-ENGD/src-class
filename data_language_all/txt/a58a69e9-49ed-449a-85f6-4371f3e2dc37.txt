About
This is a collection of files I use together on my beaglebone black
in order to power my own project.
This project consists of a simple 5V relay that is controlled
over the internet, the python server listens for post requests and then
it updates the GPIO pin accordingly.
Since it's Christmas, at least at the time of writting this, I'll use
this on my Christmas Tree.
