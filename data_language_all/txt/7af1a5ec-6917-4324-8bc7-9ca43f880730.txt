A set of string utilities for Dart.

API Docs
isBlank checks if a string is null, empty or made of whitespace characters.
isEmpty checks if a string is null or empty.
isNotEmpty checks if a string is not null and not empty.
equalsIgnoreCase checks if two strings are equal, ignoring case.
compareIgnoreCase compares two strings, ignoring case.
reverse reverses the order of characters in a string.
nullToEmpty turns null to empty string, and returns non-empty strings
unchanged.
emptyToNull turns empty string to null, and returns non-empty strings
unchanged.
loop allows you to loop through characters in a string starting and ending at
arbitrary indices. Out of bounds indices allow you to wrap around the string,
supporting a number of use-cases, including:

Rotating: loop('lohel', -3, 2) => 'hello'
Repeating, like repeat, but with better character-level control, e.g.:
loop('la ', 0, 8) => 'la la la'  // no tailing space
Tailing: loop('/path/to/some/file.txt', -3) => 'txt'
Reversing: loop('top', 3, 0) => 'pot'
