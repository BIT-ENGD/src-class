emacs-config
My emacs config, complete with automatic install of packages.
Some things to note

Marmalade is included as a package repo and a set of packages are
  automatically installed at startup if they are not already installed.  See
  init/my-packages.el for details.
We're aiming to be modular, so any config that is beyond setting simple
  configuration items is encapsulated in a separate .el file and loaded by
  init.el.  Config modules are in the init subdirectory.
Operating system specific configuration goes in its own module, which is
  conditionally loaded at startup depending on which OS emacs detects.
