Firebase iOS Open Source Development 
This repository contains a subset of the Firebase iOS SDK source. It currently
includes FirebaseCore, FirebaseAuth, FirebaseDatabase, FirebaseFirestore,
FirebaseFunctions, FirebaseMessaging and FirebaseStorage.
Firebase is an app development platform with tools to help you build, grow and
monetize your app. More information about Firebase can be found at
https://firebase.google.com.
Installation
See the three subsections for details about three different installation methods.
1. Standard pod install
1. Installing from the GitHub repo
1. Experimental Carthage
Standard pod install
Go to
https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup.
Installing from GitHub
For releases starting with 5.0.0, the source for each release is also deployed
to CocoaPods master and available via standard
CocoaPods Podfile syntax.
These instructions can be used to access the Firebase repo at other branches,
tags, or commits.
Background
See
the Podfile Syntax Reference
for instructions and options about overriding pod source locations.
Step-by-step Source Pod Installation Instructions
For iOS, copy a subset of the following lines to your Podfile:
pod 'Firebase' # To enable Firebase module, with `@import Firebase` support
pod 'FirebaseCore', :git => 'https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk.git', :tag => '5.0.0'
pod 'FirebaseAuth', :git => 'https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk.git', :tag => '5.0.0'
pod 'FirebaseDatabase', :git => 'https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk.git', :tag => '5.0.0'
pod 'FirebaseFirestore', :git => 'https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk.git', :tag => '5.0.0'
pod 'FirebaseFunctions', :git => 'https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk.git', :tag => '5.0.0'
pod 'FirebaseMessaging', :git => 'https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk.git', :tag => '5.0.0'
pod 'FirebaseStorage', :git => 'https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk.git', :tag => '5.0.0'
For macOS and tvOS, copy a subset of the following:
pod 'FirebaseCore', :git => 'https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk.git', :tag => '5.0.0'
pod 'FirebaseAuth', :git => 'https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk.git', :tag => '5.0.0'
pod 'FirebaseDatabase', :git => 'https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk.git', :tag => '5.0.0'
pod 'FirebaseStorage', :git => 'https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk.git', :tag => '5.0.0'

Make sure you have at least CocoaPods version 1.4.0 - pod --version.
Delete pods for any components you don't need, except FirebaseCore must always be included.
Update the tags to the latest Firebase release. See the
release notes.
Run pod update.

Examples
To access FirebaseMessaging via a checked out version of the firebase-ios-sdk repo do:
pod 'FirebaseMessaging', :path => '/path/to/firebase-ios-sdk'
pod 'FirebaseCore', :path => '/path/to/firebase-ios-sdk'
To access via a branch:
pod 'FirebaseFirestore', :git => 'https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk.git', :branch => 'master'
pod 'FirebaseCore', :git => 'https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk.git', :branch => 'master'
Carthage (iOS only)
An experimental Carthage distribution is now available. See
Carthage.
Development
Follow the subsequent instructions to develop, debug, unit test, run integration
tests, and try out reference samples:
$ git clone git@github.com:firebase/firebase-ios-sdk.git
$ cd firebase-ios-sdk/Example
$ pod update
$ open Firebase.xcworkspace
Firestore and Functions have self contained Xcode projects. See
Firestore/README.md and
Functions/README.md.
Running Unit Tests
Select a scheme and press Command-u to build a component and run its unit tests.
Running Sample Apps
In order to run the sample apps and integration tests, you'll need valid
GoogleService-Info.plist files for those samples. The Firebase Xcode project contains dummy plist
files without real values, but can be replaced with real plist files. To get your own
GoogleService-Info.plist files:

Go to the Firebase Console
Create a new Firebase project, if you don't already have one
For each sample app you want to test, create a new Firebase app with the sample app's bundle
identifier (e.g. com.google.Database-Example)
Download the resulting GoogleService-Info.plist and replace the appropriate dummy plist file
(e.g. in Example/Database/App/);

Some sample apps like Firebase Messaging (Example/Messaging/App) require
special Apple capabilities, and you will have to change the sample app to use a unique bundle
identifier that you can control in your own Apple Developer account.
Specific Component Instructions
See the sections below for any special instructions for those components.
Firebase Auth
If you're doing specific Firebase Auth development, see
AuthSamples/README.md for instructions about
building and running the FirebaseAuth pod along with various samples and tests.
Firebase Database
To run the Database Integration tests, make your database authentication rules
public.
Firebase Storage
To run the Storage Integration tests, follow the instructions in
FIRStorageIntegrationTests.m.
Push Notifications
Push notifications can only be delivered to specially provisioned App IDs in the developer portal.
In order to actually test receiving push notifications, you will need to:

Change the bundle identifier of the sample app to something you own in your Apple Developer
account, and enable that App ID for push notifications.
You'll also need to
upload your APNs Provider Authentication Key or certificate to the Firebase Console
at Project Settings > Cloud Messaging > [Your Firebase App].
Ensure your iOS device is added to your Apple Developer portal as a test device.

iOS Simulator
The iOS Simulator cannot register for remote notifications, and will not receive push notifications.
In order to receive push notifications, you'll have to follow the steps above and run the app on a
physical device.
Community Supported Efforts
We've seen an amazing amount of interest and contributions to improve the Firebase SDKs, and we are
very grateful!  We'd like to empower as many developers as we can to be able to use Firebase and
participate in the Firebase community.
macOS and tvOS
FirebaseAuth, FirebaseCore, FirebaseDatabase and FirebaseStorage now compile, run unit tests, and
work on macOS and tvOS, thanks to contributions from the community. There are a few tweaks needed,
like ensuring iOS-only, macOS-only, or tvOS-only code is correctly guarded with checks for
TARGET_OS_IOS, TARGET_OS_OSX and TARGET_OS_TV.
For tvOS, checkout the Sample.
Keep in mind that macOS and tvOS are not officially supported by Firebase, and this repository is
actively developed primarily for iOS. While we can catch basic unit test issues with Travis, there
may be some changes where the SDK no longer works as expected on macOS or tvOS. If you encounter
this, please file an issue.
For installation instructions, see above.
