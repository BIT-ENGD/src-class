Install EOS
To test and deploy smart contracts you will want to have a local EOS node running. The easiest way to setup a node is with Docker. See the official Docker quickstart guide for instructions.
We recommend using docker-compose to manage nodeos and keosd containers. You can download the official docker-compose-latest.yml file and start the containers using these commands:
sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EOSIO/eos/master/Docker/docker-compose-latest.yml
docker volume create --name=nodeos-data-volume
docker volume create --name=keosd-data-volume
docker-compose -f docker-compose-latest.yml up
Note #1! If you are using cleos within a Docker container, you need to mount your project directory as a volume so that cleos can deploy your files. If you're using Docker Compose, add your project directory to the volumes section of the keosd container like so (abbreviated):
yaml
services:
    keosd:
        volumes:
            - ./:mnt/dev/project:ro
Note #2! If you are expecting to see console output from nodeos then be sure to add --contracts-console to the end of the nodeosd command like so (abbreviated):
yaml
services:
    nodeosd:
        command: /opt/eosio/bin/nodeosd.sh ... --contracts-console
