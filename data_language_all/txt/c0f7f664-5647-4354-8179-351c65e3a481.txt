Focus App
WIP - How much have you worked?
An small app to track the time you have wasted doing something, tasks, work, etc.
Written with Vala for Linux!

Install [WIP]
Inside the dist folder, there is a .deb package, double-click it or open a shell and type in:
sudo dpkg -i focusapp_X.Y.Z_amd64.deb
The app will be available on the Utilities/Acessories tab on your applications menu.
How to build

Install autovala 
Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/pedrolucasp/focusapp
Still on the shell, type: autovala update && cd install && cmake .. && sudo make install && cd ..

TODO
A LOT of stuff:

[ ] Separate into Classes and Objects - (Timer, Task, etc)
[ ] Stop building the View manually
[ ] Use Glade Builder to do all the View handling (this will keep code maintainable)
[ ] I18n
[ ] Make-up the app (Improve view)
