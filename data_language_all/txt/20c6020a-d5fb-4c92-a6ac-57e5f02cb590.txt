Introduction

Every time I try to write bare C++, I find myself scratching my head
Simple stuff tends not to show up in internet searches
This library aims to solve this
It contains some header files with useful functions and test modules demonstrating how to use them
A lot of this stuff is just intended to be copied and pasted, I don't want to force team members to lug this thing around
