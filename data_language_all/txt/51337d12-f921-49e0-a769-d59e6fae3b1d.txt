Contributing
Before you contribute anything make sure you set autoclrf to true.
git config --local core.autocrlf true

Coding Guidelines
A few more things:

Sort your usings
Spaces not tabs (I won't even look at the PR if you use tabs)
Follow the existing conventions you see in the project (that means, brace style, formatting etc).
If you aren't sure about something, ask in the meta room on jabbr.

Features and Bugs
After deciding you want to work on a feature or bug, comment on that issue saying that you want to do it. If you want to
discuss the feature further, join the meta room on jabbr. 
NOTE: It's important that you indicate that you want to work on a issue so that there's no overlapping work being done.
