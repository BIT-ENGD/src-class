Overview
This app is a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM  following the MVC design pattern; using Node and MySQL to query and route data in app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.


Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.


Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.


Each burger in the waiting area also has a EAT! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.


Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.


Check out this video of the app for a run-through of how it works.
