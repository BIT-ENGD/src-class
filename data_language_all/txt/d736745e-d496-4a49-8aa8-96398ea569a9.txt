A static website is made up of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It does not use any server-side language, and is delivered to the end user as it exists on the web server.
A static website generator is a tool that is used to create these websites. These tools can be well suited for a variety of web projects, including blogs, project overviews, documentation, conference sites, or collection highlights.
We'll get started with a general overview of static website generators, including a look at some of the most popular options (e.g. Jekyll & Hugo) and the benefits of using these tools. Then, we'll go through the process of creating our own static websites. Bring your laptop!
