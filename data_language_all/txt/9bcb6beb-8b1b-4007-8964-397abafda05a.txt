Snake
A curses-based implementation of the classic game Snake.
It gets starts off easy and gets easier, but then it gets impossibly hard...
The implementation is in Rust, so you need to install Rust (including cargo) from https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html.
To build and run:
bash
cargo run --release
You will need to install ncursesw:
bash
sudo apt install libncursesw5-dev
