TwentyFourHours is a library for apps that are supposed to run all day long e.g. as a public display.
It lets you specify when the app is allowed to go idle and when not.
As of Version 0.0.1 you can specify

the hour of the day after which the app is NOT allowed to go idle
the hour of the day after which the app IS allowed to go idle
for a) Monday - Friday and b) Saturday.

On Sunday the app is always allowed to go idle
