Lua t-digest library
The t-digest construction algorithm uses a variant of 1-dimensional k-means clustering to product a data structure that is related to the Q-digest, which can be used to estimate quantiles. The error bound of t-digest is relative to the quantile and has higher accuracy when computing quantiles for very small q or for q near 1. The accuracy/size tradeoff is controlled by a single parameter.
