Configurable warnings
Scala 2.13.2 introduced configurable warnings via -Wconf compiler 
flag that allows filtering and configuring compiler warnings (silence them, or turn them into errors). Details can be 
found in the pull request to Scala.
For example, if you want to turn the warning "fruitless type test" showed in the video, you need to add the following option to build.sbt
scalacOptions += "-Wconf:cat=unchecked:e"
