Emacs devdocs-lookup
This package provides an interactive function devdocs-lookup to
quickly jump to documentation on a particular API at
devdocs.io with your browser. It works similarly
to javadoc-lookup, using
your locally-configured completing-read to select an entry.
The currently supported "subjects" are the same as devdocs.io.
Optional Configuration
To bypass indicating the subject on each lookup, devdocs-lookup can
generate interactive commands for each of the individual subjects by
calling devdocs-setup. Your Emacs initialization file might contain
the following snippet.
~~~el
(devdocs-setup)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-h C-c") #'devdocs-lookup-c)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-h C-p") #'devdocs-lookup-python)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-h C-=") #'devdocs-lookup-cpp)
