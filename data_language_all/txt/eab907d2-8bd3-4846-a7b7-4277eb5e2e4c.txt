My Dotfiles
This started off as a fork of Mathias Bynen's excellent OS X dotfiles, but I need to break it off into a separate project because I want a set of cross-platform dotfiles I can use on both Mac and Linux machines. I'm probably going to keep an eye on the original repository for useful commits, but it's mostly going to branch off. Making a separate project also gives me more control over how the files are organized, as there's a lot in the original I don't use or that's growing too long.
I kept the MIT license as that's what the original was under.
To Use
You can clone the project and run bootstrap.sh to get started. update.sh is a subset of bootstrap.sh which syncs only the inc directory with the home folder; it's useful because the files in inc tend to be the most frequently edited ones.
For a fresh OS install, the apt-get.sh and brew.sh scripts in the config directory install packages using apt and homebrew respectively. cask.sh will install Mac apps using homebrew cask. The osx.sh script is a set of defaults for OS X.
Structure
Everything is sourced through .bash_profile. The files which .bash_profile includes are in the inc folder of this project. To keep file sizes down, some of these files are sourced indirectly through other inc files, rather than directly via .bash_profile. For instance, functions.sh sources a series of "cheat sheet" reminder functions in cheat-sheet.sh.
One-time setup scripts meant to be run on a brand new OS reside in setup.
Global configuration files reside in the config folders. If you're looking for a file which ends in "rc" it's probably in here (other than .bashrc).
