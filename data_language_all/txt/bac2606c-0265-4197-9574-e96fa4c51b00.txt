Valkyrie, Death's Messenger
The only true support in the lineup so far, Valkyrie has a mix of offensive and defensive abilities fitting with her theme.
This hero, oddly enough, started with the name, but relatively little thinking was needed for her abilities.
Abilities
Soul Rip
Valkyrie empowers her next attack, giving it bonus range and damage. In addition, it will rip the soul out of its target, slowing it and summoning an illusion that transfers a portion of damage taken to the original.

The illusion is created in front of Valkyrie and can't attack or move.
The illusion can't be killed, but will disappear if the target dies or another target is hit with Soul Rip.
