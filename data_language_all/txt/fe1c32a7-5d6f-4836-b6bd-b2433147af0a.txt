Setup
Add the dependency:
libraryDependencies += "com.cynance" %% "alpaca-scala" % "3.0.0"
The library requires configuration that consists of these 3 properties
* accountKey - The account key from the alpaca account.
* accountSecret - The account secret from the alpaca account.
* isPaper - Determines whether an account is a paper trading account.
The order the configuration properties are read are :
 * Class Instantiation - When the Alpaca class is instantiated, it can have the arguments of accountKey, accountSecret and isPaper.
 * Config File - This library will automatically pick up from an application.conf for example:
 yaml
alpaccaauth {
    accountKey : 'blah',
    accountSecret : 'asdfv',
    isPaper : 'true'
}
* Env Variables - You can also pass in system environment variables and it will pick those up.
