WoW-Addon: Miscellaneous tweaks and improvements
This addon contains several customizations that I felt were missing, among them ...

searchable spell book
tradeskill tooltips when hovering lines in the profession book
tradeskill levels (green, yellow, orange, grey) in profession book, taken from LibPeriodicTable
on respec, combine unlearned and learned messages (and filter duplicates)
search your spellbook for unused/unbound spells (supports action bars, macros on bars, shapeshift bars, Clique config)
add train all button to trainer dialogs
adds things to quest tracker: current battle pet team status, current profession skill levels. Right click quest tracker heading to hide/show these

Also functions as my personal lua playground ;)
