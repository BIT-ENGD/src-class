420! Alarm

Download on the App Store
We all need time to kick back and relax. With 420! you'll get exactly that: a simple alarm that goes off to remind you, on your iOS device or Apple Watch, to take a break. Because life is tough, and it should be, but you've gotta take a step back and chill out every once and a while.

We intend for this project to be an educational resource: we are excited to
share our wins, mistakes, and methodology of iOS development as we work
in the open. Our primary focus is to continue improving the app for our users in
line with our roadmap.
The best way to submit feedback and report bugs is to open a GitHub issue.
Please be sure to include your operating system, device, version number, and
steps to reproduce reported bugs. Keep in mind that all participants will be
expected to follow our code of conduct.
