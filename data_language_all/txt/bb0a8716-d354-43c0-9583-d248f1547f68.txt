Mutational Signatures
Mutational Signatures (abbreviated as mtsg) finds and quantifies COSMIC
mutational signatures across samples.
mtsg uses a base set of mutational signatures extracted by SigProfiler for
single-base substitutions (SBS), i.e., single-nucleotide variants (SNV),
using 2780 whole-genome variant calls from the ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis
of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) project.
Prerequisites

Python ^3.8
sigproSS ^0.0.0



Install
Use Poetry to install mtsg and its dependencies.
$ poetry install --no-dev
mtsg init can then be used to install base mutational matrices given a
supported genome build.
$ mtsg init --genome-build <genome-build>
Replace <genome-build> with one of GRCh37, GRCh38 (Homo sapiens),
mm9, mm10 (Mus musculus), or rn6 (Rattus norvegicus).
Usage
Mutational Signatures is installed as the executable mtsg. It has three
commands: init, run, and visualize.
Run
run is used to profile samples (as VCFs) using known mutational signatures.
The selected genome build must match the input VCFs and previously installed
during the installation.

Visualize
visualize uses signature activities (generated by run and typically named
Sig_activities.txt) to create an interactive plot.

Docker
Mutational Signatures has a Dockerfile to create a container image, which
sets up and installs the required runtime and dependencies. It installs
reference files for only GRCh38 and uses COMSIC mutational signatures 3.1. To
build and use this image, install Docker
for your platform.
Build
In the Mutational Signatures project directory, build the container image.
$ docker image build --tag mtsg .
Run
The image uses mtsg as its entrypoint, giving access to all commands.
$ docker container run mtsg <args...>
For example, a typical workflow is to run the run command followed by visualize.
