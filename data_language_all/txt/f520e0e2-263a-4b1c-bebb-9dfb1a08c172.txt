excerpt: Resources for querying search hits statistics
categories: api-search_analysis

There are four resources available for querying search hits statistics,
listed here by their relation type:
* q_search_look: number of search hits by look date
* q_search_travel: number of search hits by travel date
* q_search_evolution: time series of number of search hits
* q_search_variation: variations of number of hits between two periods
The representation of all datasets follows the
JSON-stat standard.
The only exception is the ability to refer to dimension descriptions through
JSONAPI links instead of uri attributes.
