Hello, my name is Nicolas (h4wk3r on irc #Wazo). I am a currently alternating between my studies for a Master in Computer Engineering and my work in a call center. I could not find any information in the XiVO CTI when a phone was disconnected, so I worked on a solution for generating this information. This allows agents to know their phone's status.
Let us imagine the following scenario: An agent in a call center is connected with is softphone 'N. SIP XXX'. He logs in via his XiVO Client in order to receive calls from his assigned queues. One of the following 3 events occurs :

A:  The softphone is disconnected from asterisk . 
B: The agent finishes his day, turns off his softphone but forgets to disconnect his XiVO Client.
C: The agent is at home, the VPN tunnel stops.

In these 3 examples, the agent cannot know if he can still recieve calls because he does not recieve any alerts from his XiVO client or from the phone.

I. Standard operation

Agent's point of view



Point of view on the XiVO Server





II. Anomaly


Agent's point of view
Let us simulate the anomaly. For this simulation, the softphone has been forcefully disconnected.



We can see that our agent is still logged in and no other information about the disconnection is displayed
Point of view on the XiVO Server



We can see that the state of extension 741 is UNKNOWN, but agent 6002 (extension 728) is still connected.

III. Execution of the script

The script will find out that the SIP account is disconnected and will automatically log out the agent associated to the extension.



Accordingly, the agent now knows that he is logged out:
