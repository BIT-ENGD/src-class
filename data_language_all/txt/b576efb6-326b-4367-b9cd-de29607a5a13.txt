Introduction
The purpose of this document is to provide you with minimal knowledge of Go and Hyperledger Fabric (Fabric for short) infrastructure to enable you to start writing and debugging chaincode. This is not an extensive lession but you will have gained sufficient knowledge to move on to developing real-world chaincode.
This document is intended for anyone with programming experience but having no or very little experience of Go and chaincode development. However, you are expected to be sufficiently familiar with the concept of compilation and packaging, as Go is a compiled, not scripting, langauge.
In this document, you will learn to:

Setup for chaincode development
Setting up a development environment for chaincode projects is no different from setting up for other non chaincode Go projects. 
For a basic (terminal and command-line) environment for chaincode development, please follow the following steps:


Install Go tools.


for macOS, we recommend installing via homebrew;


for other platforms please refer to installation guide.


Additional notes for this setp:


Please also ensure that you also install C++ compiler. Refer to your respective platform documentation for instructions.


On Ubuntu you may also need to install a library call ltdl (please refer to apt-get install ltdl-dev).




Set the environmental variable GOPATH to a reference a directory to host your Go source codes and binaries (i.e. Go workspace). For example,
export GOPATH=$HOME/go-projects


Navigate to the $GOPATH directory and install a Go application call Govendor by executing this command:
go get -u github.com/kardianos/govendor
At the completion of the command, you will find in $GOPATH three directories:
drwxr-xr-x  3 <userid>  <groupid>  102  3 Feb 15:44 bin
drwxr-xr-x  3 <userid>  <groupid>  102  3 Feb 15:44 pkg
drwxr-xr-x  3 <userid>  <groupid>  102  3 Feb 15:44 src
This structure is dictated by Go tooling and will be your primary workspace for organising your chaincodes and and other dependencies such as third parties codes, tooling extensions, etc.
In the context of chaincode development, you will be working mainly with Go sources. Hence, you only need to concern yourself with organising stuff within src directory.
Additional notes for this step:


This step is not strictly needed. You could have create the workspace directories manually.


Govendor is a package or dependency management tool. It is one of many tools you can use to manage Go dependencies. The choice of Govendor is purely based on familarity. You could elect to install other tools).




Add the $GOPATH/bin to your PATH environmental variable. For example:
export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH
$GOPATH/bin is a directory for binaries generated from Go compilations. Some of these binaries may be used to extend the functionalities of Go tooling or any other support tools. If you are using Visual Studio Code, you will find extensions to the editor such as code completion or syntax highlighting, served from this directory.


Get the Fabric dependencies (the framework to support your chaincode developmemnt) by issuing the following commands:
go get -d github.com/hyperledger/fabric
At the completion of this command, you will see this message:
package github.com/hyperledger/fabric: no buildable Go source files in /Users/blockchain/workspace/misc/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric
There is no need to worry. Go tooling typically pull source code and then tries to build a binary but in this case the hyperledger fabric dependencies have nothing to be built.
If you wish to ensure that the dependencies have been pulled down, simply navigate to $GOPATH/src/github.com and if you see the directory hyperledger it means that dependencies have been downloaded. 


Minimal Go for Chaincode
If you are already and experience Go programmer you can skip this section.
To learn about Go progranmning language, please refer to these resources:


Go playground - This a a web-base development environment where you can learn to code in Go without the need to setup a local development environment.


Go by example - This is a series of code snippets demonstrating features of Go by theme.


To create a minimal chaincode focus your learning on these areas 


data types;


functions;


structs;


interfaces.


You will also need to be aware that all your Go codes (and chaincodes) have to be organised around $GOPATH/src directory. For example, here is a hypothetical structure:
$GOPATH/src
        git.ng.bluemix.net/project/repo
            cmd
                main.go
            helper
                math.go
        github/spf13/corbra // Third parties code
            ....
Organise your code and dependencies to reflect the way codes would be stored in a typical Git-like repository. Please refer to the official documentation about code organisation.
Writing chaincode
In this section you will learn to:


write the smallest unit of executable chaincode;


organise your chaincode project.


Smallest unit of executable chaincode
A minimal executable Go code is this:

To compile and execute this code all you need to do is to issue the command go run. It will run in your macOS, Linux, Windows or any compatible platform.
In the case of chaincode, the smallest unit of executable code is this:

Place your code in the file chaincode.go under the appropriate part of your Go workspace for example, $GOPATH/src/github.com/user/repo/chaincode.go.
To get a sense of whether the code is workable, navigate to the directory containing your main chaincode file and execute go run command. For example:
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/user/repo/
go run chaincode.go
You will see the following output:
<Date> <Timestamp> <Timezone> [shim] SetupChaincodeLogging -> INFO 001 Chaincode log level not provided; defaulting to: INFO
<Date> <Timestamp> <Timezone> [shim] getPeerAddress -> CRIT 002 peer.address not configured, can't connect to peer
exit status 1
This simply indicates that the chaincode has been successfully compiled and your code has been executed. However, there is no running Fabric infastructure to interact with so you see this error message.
Unlike normal Go program, you can't just compile and run chaincode in macOS, Linux, Windows, etc. Instead you will need to bundle the code and deploy it to a running Fabric platform known as a Fabric peer (see architecture for detailed explanation). 
A Fabric peer typically runs in a Docker container. You could "natively" deploy a peer as part of a component of macOS, Linux, Windows, etc., but is beyond the scope of this document to discuss these types of configuration. We'll only focus on the Docker deployment here.

Note


In the import clause of your chaincode, you'll see this github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim, which is a Fabric component (i.e. think library if you are C++ programmer).


The import is derived from $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric.



Organising your chaincode project
It is extremely unusual to create a chaincode from a single file. 
You may want to re-use aspects of a Go code developed by third parties and/or separate out your functional from non-functional (e.g. string formatter) dependencies. Hence, you may want to distribute chaincode in different files and/or directories.
If you were working on a Go project you would organise your dependencies this way:
$GOPATH/
    src/
        github.com/anotheruser/repo/
            anothersrc.go
        github.com/user/repo/
            mypkg/
                mysrc1.go
                mysrc2.go
            cmd/mycmd/
                main.go
Your Go project github.com/user/repo is dependent on github.com/anotheruser/repo to provide a service. This is a sufficient structure to compile and run code on macOS, Linux, Windows, etc.
In the case of chaincode development, that structure will not work. You will need to organise all your dependencies under one root directory and then deploy the root directory to a Fabric peer. 
Here is an example of a hypothetical chaincode project with dependencies in a vendor folder:
$GOPATH/
    src/
        github.com/user/repo/
            mychaincode/
                util/
                    mymaths.go
                chaincode.go
                vendor/
                    github.com/anotheruser/repo
                        anothersrc1.go
                        anothersrc2.go
                    vendor.json
In this example:


mychaincode is the root directory encapsulating your entire chaincode artifacts including dependencies;


util is an example custom directory created by you to support your chaincode;


vendor is a special directory (with a file vendor.json) typically to package dependencies not located at the chaincode root or dependencies from third parties (see detailed explanations of the use of vendor folder);


github.com/anotheruser/repo is a dependency that is referenced by chaincode.go, which would have existed outside you chaincode root folder but it is now in the vendor folder.


You can manually create and provision the vendor directory but using tools makes it easier. As per the setup step, let's use Govendor to vendor your dependencies: 


Navigate to $GOPATH/src/github.com/user/repo/mychaincode and execute this command:
govendor init


You should see a directory call vendor.


In the directory vendor add the following line to vendor.json:
"ignore": "test github.com/hyperledger/fabric"
This line tells govendor not to include github.com/hyperledger/fabric and test dependencies. You don't need to include hyperledger fabric dependency because it is part of the fabric peer infrastructure.


We are going to vendor a third party dependency github.com/anotheruser/repo by issuing this command:
govendor fetch github.com/anotheruser/repo
If no error you will see the dependencies stored in vendor directory.



Note:


Go (and chaincode) tooling typically search for dependencies from $GOPATH but the presence of vendor will enable Go tool to search there first.


What if I wish to re-use another project that is outside the chaincode root directory in the Go workspace but not yet in say github.com repo?


For example, this is my code structure:
$GOPATH/
    src/
        github.com/user/another-repo/
            support/
                superduper-support.go
            superduper-algo.go
        github.com/user/repo/
            mychaincode/
                chaincode.go
                util/
                    mymaths.go
                vendor/
                    github.com/user/another-repo
                        support/
                            superduper-support.go
                        superduper-algo.go
                    vendor.json
I wish to vendor github.com/user/another-repo/, but it does not yet exists in my github.com repo, into mychaincode directory.
In this case run the command govendor add github.com/user/another-repo. You could also use this command govendor add +external. This will pull ALL the artefacts in $GOPATH into vendor folder. 
It is beyond the scope of this document to discuss all use cases pertaining to govendor. Please refer to Govendor documentation for details.



Fabric for chaincode development
In this section, you will learn:


about roles of the components of a minimal Fabric;


setup a minimal Fabric infrastructure


Roles of minimal Fabric infrastructure
In order to see your chaincode in action, you'll need to setup Fabric infrastructure and deploy your chaincode there. A full featured running Fabric infrastructure has many components.
For the purpose of document, we'll focus on the most minimal Fabric infrastructure to enable you to probe a running chaincode. 
We'll be using Docker. If you have not setup Docker please refer to documentation. You can see an example of a minimal infrastructure configuration here. 
The docker containers that comprise a minimal Fabric infastructure are: 


orderer.example.com where it's role is beyond the scope of document and for simplicity just think of it as a manager for the next component;


peer0.org1.example.com is the container that will be responsible for spinning up another container to support your running chaincode;


cli is a command line container that you use to interact with peer0.org1.example.com.



NOTE
This is not an setup for use in, or representative of, any mission critical blockchain use case. This is only to support a simple chaincode development process by enabling developer to get feedback from a running chaincode.
There are also other aspects of the hyperledger fabric infrastructure that is beyond the scope of this document. These are cryptography components, which need not concern you for current discussion.
For detailed descriptions of the roles of hyperledger fabric components, please refer to hyperledger fabric architecture explained.

Setup a minimal hyperledger fabric
The components to enable you to orchestrate a minimal hyperledger fabric infrastructure is provided together with this document when you check-out this repo. You can find it here.
Navigate to location containing the minimal fabric component cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hlf-go/writing-chaincode/fabric. You will find the following items


docker-compose.yml for configuring docker containers;


membership polcy assets configuration file (configtx.yml) and crypto config (crypto-config.yaml) file;


a collection of scripts to install, instantiate and invoke chaincode (see folder scripts);


a script to help you generate your tiny fabric network (fabricOps.sh).


In the case of fabricOps.sh, you use it to:
| Command | Action | Comments |
|---|---|---|
| fabricOps.sh start | Start a running fabric infrastructure | This command will generate cryptographic assets based on configtx.yml and crypto config that are needed for peer0.org1.example.com to work with orderer.example.com containers as specified in the docker-compose.yaml file |
| fabricOps.sh status | Check status of docker containers | This operation is used to check the status of your docker containers.This example shows all the relevant containers are running properly: dev-peer0.org1.example.com-mycc-1.0: Up 24 secondspeer0.org1.example.com: Up 26 minutescli: Up 26 minutesorderer.example.com: Up 26 minutes |
| fabricOps.sh clean | Reset the fabric infrastructure | This operation removes cryptographic and docker artefacts. NOTES: This will remove ALL docker containers and images that are currently running in your machine. There is an option to only remove containers that are only responsible for running chaincodes (typically with a name containing dev- prefix). It should not impact any docker containers that you may already have in operation. Please modify fabricOps.sh accordingly. |
| fabricOps.sh cli | This operation gives you access to fabric cli | You will be given access to cli's own terminal. From there you can then execute chaincode related operations which we'll discussion on the next sections |
| ccview <cc id> <cc version> | View output of a particular chaincode and version | Specify the named you assigned to the chaincode <cc id> e.g. "mycc" and the version of chaincode <cc version> e.g. 1.0, 1.1, etc. You will be able to see output generated by Go console logging statement (e.g. fmt.Print) | 

Windows
There is currently no out-of-the-box support for Windows platform. The script fabricOps.sh only supports macOS or Linux.
For Windows user, please study the script and modify a version that is appropriate for your platform.

Debugging chaincode
In this section, you will learn to execute a simple chaincode and debug your chaincode using the infrastructure described above.
To help you get going with your learning, please follow the following steps:


Assume you have gone through the setup minimal fabric step, you should find the following in your Go workspace:
$GOPATH/src/github.com/hlf-go/
    writing-chaincode/
        fabric
Please refer to the README.md for instruction on how to attach and detach chaincodes for debugging.


When you execute fabric.sh (any commands) it will download github.com/hlf-go/example-chaincodes. You will find this in your Go workspace:
$GOPATH/src/github.com/hlf-go/
    writing-chaincode/
       fabric/
    example-chaincodes/
        minimalcc/
          chaincode.go
        ....


Navigate to $GOPATH/src/github.com/hlf-go/writing-chaincode/fabric and execute this command (on macOS and Linux only):
./fabricOps.sh start
This will take sometime. The process will download docker images and setup your docker containers.


Execute the following command:
./fabricOps.sh cli
In your bash terminal, you will be presented with the terminal running from the cli container:
root@<your-container-id>:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer#
1. In the cli execute appropriate commands:


To deploy a brand new chaincode. 
root@<your-container-id>:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# ./scripts/instantiate.sh <flag>
You can get instruction on the appropriate flag settings by running the command instantiate.sh.


To deploy an upgraded version of the chaincode
root@<your-container-id>:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# ./scripts/upgrade.sh <flag>
You can get instruction on the appropriate flag settings by running the command install.sh.


To invoke a particular chaincode transaction.
root@<your-container-id>:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# ./scripts/invoke.sh <flag>



Note:


All the chaincode for deployment are held in directory /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go in the cli container. When using the script to deploy the chaincode all you need to do is to specify the root folder containing the chaincode of your choice. For example, if you have a chaincode packaged in /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/minimalcc, simply specify the name minimalcc as the chaincode package you wish to deploy.


The term "deploy" is used loosely here. It is actually a two-step process. You perform an installation and then instantiation or upgrade of a chaincode. 


If you deploy and invoke $GOPATH/src/github.com/hlf-go/example-chaincodes/minimalcc/chaincode.go. It will produce the following console output Hello Init when the chaincode method Init is called. Hello Invoke when the chaincode method Invoke is called.





Open another terminal, navigate to $GOPATH/src/github.com/hlf-go/writing-chaincode/fabric and execute this command:
./fabricOps.sh ccview <cc id> <cc version>
Specify the chaincode and its version you wish to inspect. For example, if you wish to inspect the chaincode name minimalcc and version 1.0. 
./fabricOps.sh ccview minimalcc 1.0
Assuming the chaincode has been properly deployed and invoked, it should produce the following output:
Hello Init
Hello Invoke


Moving on
The training materials presented here are extremely stunted to help you understand basic concepts. It does not necessarily represent the only way of working. There are other ways of approaching your chaincode development.
Once you have mastered basic concepts, you are encourage to:


Consider the use of more sophisticated testing framework to verify your chaincode. Use Go unit testing framework and Fabric's mock.


Develop more complex chaincode. Please reference the hyperledger fabric samples or here for inspiration.


Work with more complex Fabric configurations, please refer to this repo for more complex Fabric setup.


Organise all your Go and non-Go (Java, Javascripts, etc) projects based on Go-style workspace as this will help you reference projects easily via the variable $GOPATH. Here is an example:
$GOPATH/
    bin/
        <useful tools in form of executable binaries>
    pkg/
        config-files/
           .....
        <other go/c libraries>/
           .....
    src/
        github.com/user/
            javascript-ui/
                .....
                package.json
            fabric-node-sdk-middleware/
                .....
                package.json
            fabric-go-sdk-middleware/
                ......
                main.go
            chaincodes/
                chaincode.go
        github.com/thirdparty/
            some-project/
                ......
