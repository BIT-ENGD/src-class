Mochachino
This project creates some simple affordances for browser testing with the Mocha javascript testing framework.
This is very much a work-in-progress (like not working yet work in progress), but some initial goals include:

Automatically pull in test and source files using glob patterns, instead of having to edit an html file manually.
Use web sockets to re-run tests in a browser automatically and report back to the command line runner (faster feedback).
CI integration for browser test.
Open to suggestion??
