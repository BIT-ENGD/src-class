Submitted by: Farida Sabry
Time spent: 4 hours spent in total
User Stories
The following required functionality is complete:
* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
The following optional features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.
Notes
The biggest challenge I faced was the fact that I own an android and my iOS simulator proved to be extremeley slow. Towards the end I couldn't even get to see my finished app because it crashed before getting there, which made it really hard to implement any further features or make a video walkthrough unfortunately. Other than that, Swift wasn't too bad and I'm slowly warming up to it.
