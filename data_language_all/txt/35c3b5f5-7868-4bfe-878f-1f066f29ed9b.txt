Snoopy Mode




Snoopy Mode is a minor mode for number row unshifted character insertion in
Emacs.
It can insert characters such as ! and @ without pressing the shift key.
Getting Started
You can install Snoopy Mode from MELPA.
M-x package-install [RET] snoopy [RET]
Usage
Inside Emacs, M-x snoopy-mode RET will enable Snoopy Mode.
If you want to enable snoopy-mode, e.g. in prog-mode, place the following
lines in your Emacs config:
```emacs-lisp
(require 'snoopy)
(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'snoopy-mode)
```
Customization
Default layout is based on the qwerty layout, you can change this two way:


pick an existing layout with snoopy-select-keyboard-layout


define your custom one with snoopy-set-custom-keyboard-layout
