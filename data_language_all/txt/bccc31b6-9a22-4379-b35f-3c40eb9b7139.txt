    2.) Database
        Pantheon creates and instantiates a database for Drupal 7 when installed.

        The database is accessed by modules, like Webforms, where forms collect data and add it to the
        database. The administrative view allows the data to be manipulated.

        The data can also be accessed and manipulated through the Database Administration module.

        The Pantheon Apache SOLR Search Module works in conjunction with the Search API module to allow
        filtering and searching within the database. Adding a view allows admin to customize search page 
        and options.

            Create Admin content type for solo artist and group registration
            Create Admin content type of generic group listings called ensembles
