btle_control
Control the arduino remotely using (quasi) serial over bluetooth LE.
The bluetooth module being used is the BLE Mini from RedBearLab - documentation and example code is available at http://redbearlab.com/blemini/. Follow instructions for downloading and installing the RBL BLEMini libraries and example code.
We are using the ardumoto shield from sparkfun to interface with the motors -documentation and code are available at https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9815. 
Quick tips when using the standard BLE Controller app for android: 
* Each motor is controlled by two pins -
    * one digital pin to set the direction
    * one PWM pin to set the speed
* Motor outputs 1/2 are controlled by
    * pin 12 (digital out, controls direction)
    * pin 3  (PWM out, controls speed)
* Motor outputs 1/2 are controlled by
    * pin 13 (digital out, controls direction)
    * pin 11 (PWM out, controls speed)
