Brick

Brick is a collection of UI components designed for the easy and quick building of web application UIs. Brick components are built using the Web Components standard to allow developers to describe the UI of their app using the HTML syntax they already know.
Install
Brick can be installed using the Bower package manager:
sh
bower install mozbrick/brick
To use Brick in your project, place the following in the <head> of your main HTML:

If you are already using Polymer, platform.js or a web browser that supports Web Components, you do not need the above <script> tag.
Development
Brick (and its components) are developed using tools built in JavaScript running on node.js.
The individual components are developed in their own GitHub repositories.
The mozbrick/brick repository contains the distributions of all the components packaged together as well as tools for building the distributions.
To work on Brick, you will need the following node tools:
bash
npm install -g bower gulp
Building Brick from source
Once you have the prerequisites, you're ready to clone and build from source.
Run the following:
bash
git clone git@github.com:mozbrick/brick.git
cd brick
npm install
bower install
gulp build
