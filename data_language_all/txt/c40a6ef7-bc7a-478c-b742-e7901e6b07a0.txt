Microservice in Play Framework used during Warsjawa 2014 workshop "Microservices in Scala".
Running
First of all, make sure you have Redis running and you stored your auth token there. For example:
$ sudo redis-server
$ redis-cli
127.0.0.1:6379> SET "auth:token:abc" "myLogin"
OK
then
$ sbt
[warsjawa-ms-play]$ ~run
After that use test/index.html for testing. Your auth token will be abc, your login myLogin.
