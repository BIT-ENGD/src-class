What is Redshift?
Project homepage

Redshift is an application that adjusts the computer display's color temperature based upon the Sun's apparent position in relation to the user's location on Earth. 
The program is free software, inspired by the proprietary f.lux, and can be used to reduce eye strain as well as insomnia and delayed sleep phase syndrome.
The computer display's color temperature transitions evenly from night to daytime temperature to allow the user's eyes to slowly adapt. At night, the color temperature is low and is typically 3000–4000 K (default is 3500 K), preferably matching the room's lighting temperature. Typical color temperature during the daytime is 5500–6500 K (default is 5500 K).

Preparations
Redshift must be installed on your system if you want to use this widget.
Packages should be available for most distributions (i.e. Ubuntu, Arch or Debian).  
Source code and build instructions can be found on Github here.
You also need a valid config file. Please see the project homepage for details. 
An example redshift.conf file:

You have to match the location settings to your personal situation: adjust the lat and lon variables - You can use google maps or wikipedia to get the approximate coordinates.
You might also want to modify the color temperatures to fit your preferences.
Using the widget
This widget provides several functions that can be used to control Redshift:

redshift:toggle():   Toggles Redshift's color adjustments on or off.
redshift:on():   Activates Redshift.
redshift:off():   This will remove the current color adjustment. (It will not kill the redshift process, however!)
redshift:attach(widget, update_function):   Attach to a (text or icon) widget.  
    Click on the widget to toggle redshift on or off. This will also auto-launch Redshift along with Awesome WM.  
update_function can be used to modify the icon/text and will be triggered each time redshift changes its status. (See the examples below.)
redshift:is_active(): Returns true if redshift is currently modifying the screen color.

Usage examples
imagebox status widget (with icon)
```lua
-- Redshift widget
icons_dir = require("lain.helpers").icons_dir
local rs_on = icons_dir .. "/redshift/redshift_on.png"
local rs_off = icons_dir .. "/redshift/redshift_off.png"
myredshift = wibox.widget.imagebox(rs_on)
lain.widgets.contrib.redshift:attach(
    myredshift,
    function ()
        if lain.widgets.contrib.redshift:is_active() then
            myredshift:set_image(rs_on)
        else
            myredshift:set_image(rs_off)
        end 
    end 
)
``
Then add themyredshift` widget to your panel.
textbox status widget
lua
-- Redshift widget
myredshift = wibox.widget.textbox("RS")
lain.widgets.contrib.redshift:attach(
    myredshift,
    function ()
        if lain.widgets.contrib.redshift:is_active() then
            myredshift:set_text("RS on")
        else
            myredshift:set_text("RS off")
        end 
    end
)
Then add the myredshift widget to your panel.
keybinding
Add this to the keybindings in your rc.lua:
lua
-- Toggle redshift with Mod+Shift+t
awful.key({ modkey, "Shift"   }, "t",   function () lain.widgets.contrib.redshift:toggle()   end) ,
