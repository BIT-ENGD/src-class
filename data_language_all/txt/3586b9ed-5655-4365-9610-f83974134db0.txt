Extensions and Hacking
The framework is built to be extendable by plugins. If you have devices that are currently not 
supported please add a plugin for your devices. 
As well, if you have nice ideas for plugins or need support for special devices you are
welcome to create an issue or submit a patch.
For plugin development take a look at the 
development guide and
plugin template.
Feel free to ask development questions at the 
plugin template repository.
