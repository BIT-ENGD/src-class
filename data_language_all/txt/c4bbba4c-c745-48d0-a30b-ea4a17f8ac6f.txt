Flutter Real World App
This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with Flutter including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.
Getting Started
It is assumed that you have installed and configured Flutter properly. If not, head to https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started and validate its correct functionality.
To start the emulator with this repository:

git clone https://github.com/digital-heroes/flutter-realworld-example-app.git
cd flutter-realworld-example-app
flutter run

How it works
This app works as a Flutter real-world showcase and is based on Flutter.
For help getting started with Flutter, view
online documentation, which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
Concepts
This RealWorld app tries to show the following Flutter concepts:
* i18n
* Bloc
* Immutable value types
* JSON serialization
* Application Settings
* Custom ActionBar
* Lazy-loading
* Modal Dialogs
* Navigation
To show as many concepts as possible the structure is not necessarily consistent but may differ between views. This example app does not claim best-practice or anything similar but just one way of achieving a result.
