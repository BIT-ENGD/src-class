Discussing Issues
If you have a bug fix, please create an issue in the relevant project repository.
If you have a new expansion pack suggestion, please create an issue in the base Cartridge project so we can discuss it.
Forking and branching
Fork the project then create a new feature branch to work on with a short feature description or the GitHub issue number as a branch name eg:
sh
git checkout -b feature/new-header
or
sh
git checkout -b feature/39
Push to your fork
sh
git push --set-upstream origin feature/MY-FEATURE
Then submit a Pull Request for review and merging by a project owner.
Commit messages
Try and adhere loosely to the Angular commit messages guidelines style.
Commitizen is a command line tool which can help with this:
sh
npm install -g commitizen
Now, simply use git cz instead of git commit when committing.
