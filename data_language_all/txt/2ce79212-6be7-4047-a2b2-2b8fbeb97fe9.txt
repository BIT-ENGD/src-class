What is this?
An Xcode File Template that creates an Objective-C Coordinator class. It is for both iOS and OS X. Inspired by a really good reading by Soroush Khanlou (Github, Twitter) about Coordinators Redux I created this Xcode file template.
Installation
Just run this shell command in your terminal:
Shell
$ curl -SL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phranck/Xcode-Coordinator-Template/master/install.sh | sh
The Coordinator template will be installed under ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File Templates/Source/.
Regarding this last path component Source/ you'll find it in Xcode under the related category Source for both iOS and OS X.

Note
In order to let the coordinator class work properly on Mac OS X, you need a navigation controller. Mac OS X doesn't support such a class. So, you might have a look to another open source software project of mine on Github: CCNNavigationController.
Xcode Template Ressources

There is a very good article which describes how to create your own Xcode file templates with lots of insights about the quite undocumented keys and variables used in the TemplateInfo.plist.
