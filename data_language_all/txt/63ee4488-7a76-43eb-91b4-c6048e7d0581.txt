ebooks
LaTeX source files for VividCortex's ebooks.
This isn't intended to be a distribution mechanism for the ebooksâ€”the final versions will be hosted on VividCortex's website. But it's a good place to collaborate on making them, getting external reviews, etc.
The directory organization convention is that each ebook will have a .tex file in the top level,
and a directory containing figures, reference material, etc.
You'll need the Roboto font and xelatex to build the PDFs, due to the custom fonts. You can't use the latex or pdflatex commands.
A quickstart for Mac users for installing LaTeX:

Install BasicTex
Install Tex Live Utility from GitHub
Open a terminal and clone this repository, then cd into it and type xelatex scalability.tex or any other ebook name. At first you'll get an error; see below to fix.
Install packages using Tex Live Utility, as needed, to fix errors
If you get an error like ! LaTeX Error: File 'footmisc.sty' not found then abort the command with Ctrl-D, and install footmisc with Tex Live Utility.
You'll need to do this a handful of times, canceling and re-running each time.
The titletoc package is part of titlesec.
When you are victorious, you'll see a lot of messages in the terminal, followed by Output written on scalability.pdf or similar.
