About lua-de
Description
lua-de is an implementation of the differential evolution
algorithm for Lua. Currently only the DE/rand/1/bin scheme is
implemented, but it is easy to change only the required functions to
suit one's needs.
lua-de is released under the MIT license.
Performance
The code was optimized to run well on LuaJIT, and should be on par
with a C implementation.
Usage
See examples/rastrigin.lua or de.lua itself. The whole library is in de.lua.
