cline
Command-line apps building library for Node.
Cline is based on Node module readline and includes history, completions, prompt,
password, confirm, input mask and (most interesting) regexp commands support.
Installation
$ npm install cline

Usage
js
    require('cline')();
If you need to provide your own command line interface,
  you can pass it as parameter, visit tests.js for mock example.
js
    var cli = require('cline')(mock);
Passing second parameter allows to get direct commands access and clean function (for test purposes)
js
    var cli = require('cline')(mock, true);
Methods
command(cmd, description, args, callback) - adds command to match user input with.
cmd - could be simple name or any other string with arguments placeholders. For ex.
js
    cli.command('#{number}', '', {number: '\\d+'});
{number} is an argument placeholder literal that will be replaced with argument regexp
description - command description used for help output
args - object containing argument name as key and valid regexp as value to form command matching pattern.
      Arguments should be unique and follow placeholders order
callback - is function to be called when command is matched,
      it gets user input and matched arguments values as parameters.
      Could be empty if you need just to register command and listen later for 'command' event.
  js
    cli.command('#{number}{cmd}', 'task command by number', {number: '\\d{1,3}', cmd: 'x|\\+|-'},
      function (input, args) {
        args.number.should.eql(12, 'number');
        args.cmd.should.eql('x', 'command');
        done();
      });
    cli.parse('#12x');
  here '#{number}{cmd}' will be replaced into '^(\d{1,3})(x|\+|-)$' regexp
additionally you can register 'match all' command using '*' to react on any input,
  though this match will not invoke 'command' event.
  js
    cli.command('*', function (input) {
      console.log(input + 'is not good, type "help" for more info');
    });
  this method have 2 short forms: name with callback only and name with description and callback.
js
    cli.command('my_command', function(){});
    cli.command('my_command', 'do it', function(){});
mode(name, description, args, callback) - similar to command. The callback is called every time mode matched,
  and all not mode commands will be removed from the scope and prompt string will change to mode name.
  Inside mode callback you can rebuild currently available commands in relation to current application status.
  See the examples section below.
init(stream) - reinitialize cli with different input output streams interface
usage - prints and returns help message
history(items) - if items are specified updates history in reverse order, else returns collected history items
parse(string) - parses user input string for matched commands
prompt(string, callback) - prompts with string specified and returns user input into callback.
      If callback function is not specified calls parse function
password(string, mask, callback) - prompts with string specified for password and returns user input into callback.
          If mask specified - hide input behind mask symbols. If mask not specified use empty symbol.
          If callback function is not specified calls parse function
confirm(string, callback) - asks user for confirmation with string specified and returns user input (converted to boolean) into callback.
          If callback function is not specified calls parse function
interact(string) - start interactive prompt for user input. Every input is parsed for matching command and prompt again.
          Calling this method second time with different string will replace prompt string.
setPrompt(string) - modifies prompt string, during interact.
close() - closes cli and stream. Allows to continue program execution after some command matched.
System commands
clear or \c - clears the terminal screen

help or \? - shows help with all commands listed

exit or \q  - close shell and exit

Events
close - fires when interface is closed

command - fires when command is matched (except system commands and '*' wildcard command),
          passes user input and matched command as listener arguments

history - fires when history item was added,
          passes history item as listener argument

usage - fires when usage was requested,
        passes printed help as listener argument
