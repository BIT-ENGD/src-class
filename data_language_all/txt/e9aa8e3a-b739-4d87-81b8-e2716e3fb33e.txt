Causeway #0.1.0
Description
Causeway is secure method for one nodejs server to interface with another a Redis server with a client-API like relationship. Redis pub/sub is utilized for communication since it's reliable, fast and secure.
Features

Register multiple Redis servers
Select a Redis server to communicate using
Client and API handshake mechanism to register connection
API listens to incoming messages from a certain registered client
Send data from client to API, recieve results of message
API recieves message from client, returns a response

Security
Since the project leverages Redis for any network communication, security should be inherently secure. This is the main reason for using redis instead of messaging directly using websockets or http.
Concerns

Each client-api connection requires around 5 Redis clients, scaling with this may become an issue. Paid cloud redis servers usually tier their plans depending on how many clients your servers require, this could get expensive quickly.
I am unsure of how this service will behave when using a cluster or redis or node servers.

Dependancies
