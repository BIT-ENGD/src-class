BundleWatch



Overview:
BundleWatch checks file sizes, ensuring bundled browser assets don't jump in file size.
BundleWatch checks for sharp increases in files sizes and can signal when something is wrong, for example:
- Adding a package that bloats the slug
- Wrong imports
- Forgetting to minify
Run bundlewatch in CI after you finish building your production assets.
BundleWatch will keep track of these files and alert you when they go over max size.
BundleWatch will update its status on your GitHub pull request, blocking builds that fail checks.
Installation
NPM:
npm install bundlewatch --save-dev

yarn add bundlewatch --dev
