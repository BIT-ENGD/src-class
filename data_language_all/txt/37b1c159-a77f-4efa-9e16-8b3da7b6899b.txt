LibSerialPort.jl
libserialport is a small, well-documented C library for general-purpose serial port communication. This is a julia wrapper for the library.
Apart from a very few non-essential functions, the entire library API (about 75 functions) is wrapped using ccall. In addition, a higher-level interface is also provided that follows Julia's IO stream interface (note: subject to change soon).
Dependencies
BinDeps.jl is required, as well as standard tools for building the C library (make, gcc/clang, etc).
Installation
This package is not in the Julia package registry. Our plan is to merge it into SerialPorts.jl. For now, it can be cloned via
julia> Pkg.clone("https://github.com/andrewadare/LibSerialPort.jl.git")

To install the C library, do Pkg.build:
julia> Pkg.build("LibSerialPort")

(This is only set up fo Unix-like systems. PRs welcome for Windows). Alternatively, follow the build instructions for a system-wide build. If installation through the package system succeeded, then
julia> readdir(joinpath(Pkg.dir("LibSerialPort"), "deps/usr/lib"))

should list your new library. Type
julia> using LibSerialPort
julia> list_ports()

to get a list of ports detected on your system.
There is currently no documentation, but the examples/ and tests/ directories contain some examples.
