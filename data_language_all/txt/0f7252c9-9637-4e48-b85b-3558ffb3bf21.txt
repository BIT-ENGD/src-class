DOT EMACS
I've been carrying around emacs configs for a decade now and need to get my shit together.  This is what I use, its ugly, its imperfect, its whatever.
It works for me.
Installation
You should only have to add this to your ~/.emacs file
$ echo '(load "~/path/to/dot-emacs/init.el")' >> ~/.emacs
TODO

start using namespaces but ran into an issue when trying to import a macro.
Clean up everything, remove unused functions/vars
