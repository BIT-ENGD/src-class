Installation
Please use the official released ros package or install more recent versions from source.  
sudo apt install ros-melodic-pluto-robot
Installation from source
All dependencies can be installed using rosdep
rosdep install pluto_robot
As explicit dependencies for navigation we refer to the following ROS packages, which are also developed by us:
* mesh_navigation
* mesh_tools
* move_base_flex
* lvr2
Software Stack
This pluto_robot software stack provides software to use the outdoor robot in
simulation and in the real world. Furthermore, example HDF5 map datasets are provided to use Pluto with the 
mesh_navigation software stack. This package has been used to evaluate the
mesh navigation stack. Thus, a couple of experiments are provided.
Additionally mesh navigation path planning and motion control with Pluto can be run in the provided 
Gazebo simulation.
This https://github.com/uos/pluto_robot software stack contains the following packages:
* pluto_bringup contains a couple of launch and config files to start up the robot with its sensors and drivers.
* pluto_description contains the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) model to model the robot and its internal
transformations
* pluto_gazebo contains the Gezebo simulation worlds, configurations and launch files to start up the respective 
environments with Pluto, see Simulation
* pluto_navigation contains dataset, map and navigation configurations to run the mesh navigation stack with Pluto
Additionally, it contains mesh navigation experiments using developed planners from the mesh navigation stack.
See Mesh Navigation for more details.
* pluto_robots is the corresponding meta package.
Simulation
You can use Pluto in an outdoor simulation environment. We provides several datasets and the corresponding environments
for the Gazebo simulation. For navigation purposes the corresponding navigation launch file should be started, too. 
The following simulation environments are currently available:

Botanical Garden at Osnabrück University: roslaunch pluto_gazebo pluto_botanical_garden.launch
Stone Quarry in the Forest in Brockum: roslaunch pluto_gazebo pluto_stone_quarry.launch
Physics building at Osnabrück University: roslaunch pluto_gazebo pluto_physics.launch

Mesh Navigation
The mesh_navigation stack provides a navigation server for 
Move Base Flex. It provides a couple of configuration files and launch 
files to start the navigation server with the configured layer plugins for the layered mesh map, and the configured
planners and controller to perform path planning and motion control in 3D (or more specifically on 2D-manifold). 
See the Demo Video:

Experiments
We provide experiments consisting of starting positions and goals to test the navigation. To run an experiment you first need to launch the navigation stack with the chosen Environment Dataset and then publish the experiments poses:
bash
roslaunch pluto_navigation experiment.launch experiment:={experiment_name}
Replace {experiment_name} with the name of the experiment you choose.
Available experiments for each dataset can be found in the Environment Dataset Section in the description of the correspoiding dataset.
How to get our datasets
To manage our datasets we use a git extension called "Git Large File Storage" or for short git LFS.
This allows us to keep this repository small while also embedding our datasets inside this repository.
To download our datasets you first need to install git LFS on your system.
After installing the git extension you will be able to clone this repository like any other git repository and the datasets will be downloaded.
If you already cloned this repository without having git LFS installed, the dataset files will just be placeholders on your local copy.
To download the datasets you again need to install git LFS on your system.
After installing the Extension you need to install the git LFS configuration locally.
This needs to be ran just once per system and repository inside the directory of your local copy of this repository.
git lfs install
Now simply fetch all available git LFS resources for your local copy of this repository.
This will download all datasets and make them available locally.
git lfs fetch --all
