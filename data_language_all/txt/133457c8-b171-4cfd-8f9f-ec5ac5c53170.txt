molst machine setup
All steps

Install Fedora (btrfs, /boot/efi (512 MiB), /boot (512 MiB), / (rest)). Add a swap partition of same size as RAM if hibernate is to be used.
Enable prio for F1-F12 in BIOS
(cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/molst/molst.git molstt && cp -a molstt/* . && cp -a molstt/.[^.]* . && rm -rf molstt && ./install.sh)
logout+login

Notes

If an error about 'Sleep verb not supported' is encountered while trying to hibernate with systemctl hibernate, this is probably because there is no swap partition to store the whole RAM.
In ranger, there is an image preview problem with a workaround https://github.com/hut/ranger/issues/104
Charging thresholds of for example 60-90 percent should be a good default according to various articles. The instructions here could be used but was avoided due to this information. tlp fullcharge can be used to fully charge the battery once ignoring thresholds.

Special directories
.inst Created by install.sh. Contains manually installed files and directories, such as cloned git repos. The other dot files and scripts may be dependent on these files, so they should not be deleted.
.sysinst Files that are copied to system directories by install.sh. These have no other purpose than backup after install.sh has finished successfully.
