Card Exchange
This is an app for sharing and storing virtual contact-cards. No need to keep physical cards anymore
as you can sync all your v-cards to your phone's contact books and all the cards shared with you
will be automatically updated if the original person updates their details.
Description

Share contact info via QR code

People have the option to keep their details publicly available for anyone on the platform to search or they can choose to keep it private and shareable only through their QR code
People can have multiple cards of themselves so they can have multiple level of details shared
People can share their card over services like WhatsApp via contact sharing too
They can also share their QR code through any platform that supports image sharing
When sharer updates information on his card, the update is propagated to everyone that card is
