 * the abstract factory and then uses the generic interface of the factory to create the concrete objects that are part
 * of the theme. The client does not know (or care) which concrete objects it gets from each of these internal
 * factories, since it uses only the generic interfaces of their products. This pattern separates the details of
 * implementation of a set of objects from their general usage and relies on object composition, as object creation is
 * implemented in methods exposed in the factory interface.
 * <p>
 * The essence of the Abstract Factory pattern is a factory interface ({@link KingdomFactory}) and its implementations (
