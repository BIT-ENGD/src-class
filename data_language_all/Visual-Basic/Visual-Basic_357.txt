'As a photo editing program, PD spends a lot of time interacting with display devices.  In early builds, it relied
' on a Microsoft-provided class to manage interactions with multiple displays (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/194578).
' That code was published in 1998 (!!!) so you can imagine that various GDI functions have improved, modified, or
' replaced since then.  That class was also causing problems under Wine, so it needed to be cleaned up and rewritten.
'
'Thus we have pdDisplays.  pdDisplays manages an array of pdDisplay classes.  It generates this list at start-up and
' can be refreshed manually by using the .RefreshDisplays function.  Its goal is simplifying interaction with display
' devices, particularly in a multiple-display environment.
