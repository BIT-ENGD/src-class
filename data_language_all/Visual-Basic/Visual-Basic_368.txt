'Last update: allow the class to create profiles directly from arbitrary files
'
'Most image formats support the notion of embedded ICC profiles.  ICC profiles can be used to convert an image
' to its "purest" color representation, taking into account any pecularities of the device that captured the
' image (typically a camera), and the device now being used to display the image (typically a monitor).
'
'ICC profile handling is broken into two parts: extracting the profile from an image, then applying that profile
' to the image.  The extraction step is currently handled via FreeImage or GDI+, while the application step is
' handled by LittleCMS (with a fallback to the built-in Windows ICM if we absolutely have to).  In the future I
' may look at adding ExifTool as a possibly mechanism for extracting the profile, as it provides better support
' for esoteric formats (e.g. GIF, which can technically store ICC profiles, but you never see these in the wild).
'
'Note that this class retains a copy of the ICC profile itself, which is typically a ~1-5k byte array.  When a
' pdDIB class is copied, the attached ICC profile (if any) should also be copied.
