'Last update: start whipping this class into usable shape
'
'Per its name, this class provides a simple FFT interface.  After researching a great many FFT implementations,
' I decided that it would probably be easiest to just write my own pure-VB implementation, rather than deal with
' the headache of trying to wrap something like FFTW.  There's a speed hit to doing this in pure VB (obviously),
' but it's also nicely portable, and there are enough FFT references out there that the work wasn't particularly
' demanding.
'
'This class currently includes a few different FFT approaches.  Many thanks to the following references, which were
' invaluable in getting this code right:

' (These two articles are CC-1.0-BY licensed, so many thanks to Douglas L. Jones for not just sharing his excellent code,
'  but wrapping it with a really excellent discussion of FFT implementations.)
'
'So far, only radix-2 approaches are used.  Radix-4 would be faster, but also significantly more complicated, and I'm
' not comfortable enough with FFTs to tackle them just yet.
'
'For simplicity, this class requires incoming data to be padded to powers of 2.  Zero-pad data as necessary.
