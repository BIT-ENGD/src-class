\title{patchwork: The Composer of ggplots}
\description{
\if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: align='right'}}

The 'ggplot2' package provides a strong API for sequentially
building up a plot, but does not concern itself with composition of multiple
plots. 'patchwork' is a package that expands the API to allow for
arbitrarily complex composition of plots by providing mathmatical operators
for combining multiple plots. Other packages that addresses this need (but
with a different approach) are 'gridExtra' and 'cowplot'.
}
\section{Overview}{

The use and premise of \code{patchwork} is simple: Just add \code{ggplot2} plots
together to compose multiplot layouts. Because of this simplicity there is
not much more to say. Still, a few functions allow you to modify the
behaviour:
\itemize{
\item \code{\link[=plot_layout]{plot_layout()}} allows you to define the grid that plots are put into
\item \code{\link[=plot_spacer]{plot_spacer()}} inserts a completely empty plot thus pushing the subsequent
plots one cell.
}

That's it...

\examples{
library(ggplot2)
# You can add plots saved to variables

p1 <- ggplot(mtcars) + geom_point(aes(mpg, disp))
p2 <- ggplot(mtcars) + geom_boxplot(aes(gear, disp, group = gear))

p1 + p2

# Or build it up in one step
ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(mpg, disp)) +
  ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(gear, disp, group = gear))
