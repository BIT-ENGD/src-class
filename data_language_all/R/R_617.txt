\title{gganimate: A Grammar of Animated Graphics}
\description{
\if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: align='right'}}

The grammar of graphics as implemented in the 'ggplot2' package has
    been successful in providing a powerful API for creating static 
    visualisation. In order to extend the API for animated graphics this package
    provides a completely new set of grammar, fully compatible with 'ggplot2' 
    for specifying transitions and animations in a flexible and extensible way.
