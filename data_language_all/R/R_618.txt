\title{A trail of evenly spaced old frames}
\usage{
shadow_trail(distance = 0.05, max_frames = Inf, ...,
  exclude_layer = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{distance}{The temporal distance between the frames to show, as a
fraction of the full animation length}

\item{max_frames}{The maximum number of shadow frames to show}

\item{...}{changes to the shadow data, e.g. \code{alpha = alpha/2} or
\code{colour = 'grey'}}

\item{exclude_layer}{Indexes of layers that should be excluded.}
}
\description{
This shadow will trace the movement in your animation by keeping every \emph{n}th
frame and will thus produce a breadcrumb-like trail. Note that the shadow
frames will not be equidistant in space but in time (that is, if a point
moves slowly the \emph{crumbs} will be closer to each other). It is possible to
modify the look of the shadow by changing the different graphic parameters in
the data
