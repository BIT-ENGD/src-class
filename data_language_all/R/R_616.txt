\title{Let the view follow the data in each frame}
\usage{
view_follow(fixed_x = FALSE, fixed_y = FALSE, exclude_layer = NULL,
  aspect_ratio = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{fixed_x, fixed_y}{Either a logical indicating if the dimension should
not be modified by the view, or a numeric vector giving the lower and upper
bounds of the dimension. For the latter, an \code{NA} value will be substituted
for whatever is calculated by the view (e.g. \code{fixed_x = c(0, NA)}) will fix
the minimum x value to 0 and let the view calculate the upper bound.}

\item{exclude_layer}{Integer vector of layer indices that should be ignored
when calculating the view}

\item{aspect_ratio}{If the coord is fixed, ensure that the view matches the
given aspect ratio. Will override anything given in \code{fixed_x}/\code{fixed_y}}
}
\description{
This view will set the panels to include the data present in the frame.
}
\examples{

# `view_follow()` can be combined with `transition_states()` to follow
# transitions in each frame.

p <- ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) +
 geom_point() +
 labs(title = "{closest_state}") +
 transition_states(Species, transition_length = 4, state_length = 1) +
 view_follow()

# animate(p)
