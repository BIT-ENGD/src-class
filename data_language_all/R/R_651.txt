# Unit test for CausalImpact imports.
#
# Checks whether `CausalImpact()` can be called without attaching the
# CausalImpact package. The aim of this test is to check whether CausalImpact
# correctly imports all functions needed.
#
# We therefore intentionally do not call `library(CausalImpact)` in this test.
