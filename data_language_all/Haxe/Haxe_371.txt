/**
@manual Default settings for widgets

If you use similar settings for many widgets (e. g. same color and size for buttons,
or same font for text fields), you don't need to set respective attributes to every tag in xml.
You just need to create xml file with default settings.
Basic example for defaults can be found in samples/defaults/ on <a href="https://github.com/RealyUniqueName/StablexUI" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
