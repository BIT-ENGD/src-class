== Chocolatey? ==
"I'm a tools enabler, a global silent installer. I met your mother.
 Some want to call me apt-get for Windows, I just want to get #chocolatey!"

Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows (like apt-get but for Windows).
 It was designed to be a decentralized framework for quickly installing
 applications and tools that you need. It is built on the NuGet
 infrastructure currently using PowerShell as its focus for delivering
 packages from the distros to your door, err computer.

Chocolatey is brought to you by the work and inspiration of the community,
 the work and thankless nights of the Chocolatey Team
 (https://github.com/orgs/chocolatey/members), and Rob (@ferventcoder)
 heading up the direction.

You can host your own sources and add them to chocolatey, you can extend
 chocolatey's capabilities, and folks, it's only going to get better.

== Chocolatey gods? ==
Humor related to playing off of tiki gods. We like humor. Don't take life
 so seriously, you will never get out alive.
