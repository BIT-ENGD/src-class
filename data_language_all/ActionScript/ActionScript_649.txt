		 * Adds a callback that will only be called during a scheduled time each frame.  Grouped callbacks use a central trigger list,
		 * meaning that if multiple ICallbackCollections trigger the same grouped callback before the scheduled time, it will behave as
		 * if it were only triggered once.  For this reason, grouped callback functions cannot have any parameters.  Adding a grouped
		 * callback to a ICallbackCollection will undo any previous effects of addImmediateCallback() or addDisposeCallback() made to the
		 * same ICallbackCollection.  The callback function will not be called recursively as a result of it triggering callbacks recursively.
		 * @param relevantContext If this is not null, then the callback will be removed when the relevantContext object is disposed via SessionManager.dispose().  This parameter is typically a 'this' pointer.
		 * @param groupedCallback The callback function that will only be allowed to run during a scheduled time each frame.  It must not require any parameters.
		 * @param triggerCallbackNow If this is set to true, the callback will be triggered to run during the scheduled time after it is added.
