`cache-file` looks for a file in private-cache-dir previously cached with key
(which in this case carries modification dates and POLLEN env).
If a cached file is found, copies it to dest-file (which must not exist already, unless exists-ok? is true)
Otherwise, fetch-dest-file is called; if dest-file exists after calling fetch-dest-file,
it is copied to private-cache-dir and recorded with key.
