; Exercise 1.14.  Draw the tree illustrating the process generated by the count-change procedure of

; This algorithm for solving Coins problem is greedy type.
;
; Orders of growth:
;   time: 
;     Time complexity can be derived by following reasoning which is explained here 
;     http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2007/06/28/sicp-section-123/
;
;     For 1 coin of value 1 cent it takes n steps to figure out that there is only one way to change them.
;
;     For 2 coins of {1, 5} cents we can use n/5 coins of 5 cents and fill the rest with 1 cent coins.
;     In average it will take n/5 steps to fill 5 coins and n/2 steps to fill 1 cent coins.
;     Therefore, for big n it takes O(n^2) order of growth
;
;     This way we can go and recursivelly iterate until any amount of coins and we will get that if 
;     there are 5 types of coins (as we have in our case) it will have order of growth of O(n^5) for
;     big values of n.
;
;
;   space: 
;       If we draw graphs of the calls for 11 and 22 cents, we can see that depth of graph is linearly
;       dependant on the size of the problem. So lets say order of growth in space is O(n)
