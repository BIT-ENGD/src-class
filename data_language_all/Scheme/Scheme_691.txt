; The process that a procedure generates is of course dependent on the rules used by the interpreter.
; As an example, consider the iterative gcd procedure given below.
; Suppose we were to interpret this procedure using normal-order evaluation,

; Using the substitution method (for normal order), illustrate the process generated in evaluating (gcd 206 40)
; and indicate the remainder operations that are actually performed.
; How many remainder operations are actually performed in the normal-order evaluation of (gcd 206 40)? In the applicative-order evaluation?
