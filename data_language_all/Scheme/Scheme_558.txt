;; Story: When I released GNU Artanis-0.2.1, RMS had asked me if I can
;;        support LibreJS for freeing Javascript code in the generated code.
;;        I promised I will. This took almost one year since I was very
;;        busy on developing a new product (partly use GNU Artanis, of course),
;;        so it's delayed. Till few months ago, RMS sent mail to ask me
;;        if I'm ready for it, I realized that the release of GNU Artanis
;;        is much delayed.
;;        LibreJS is a way to detect non-free JS code to help you to avoid
;;        the non-trivial JS code for certain hidden features. Some of them
;;        are dangerous, some are stolen your privacy, some are just don't
;;        let you know what's going on.
;;        GNU Artanis may generate JS code automatically, they're licensed as
;;        free software definitely. This free-JS-announcement is used to
;;        license all the generated JS code in the page to GPLv3.
;;        This announcement is useful when you have LibreJS plugin in your
;;        browser to detect the JS automatically.
;;        Although you're free to relicense the code to whatever you prefer,
;;        I wish you could free the code, no matter what license name it is.
