;; A numeric vector giving the Third Series of measurements of the
;; passage time of light recorded by Newcomb in 1882. The given
;; values divided by 1000 plus 24 give the time in millionths of a
;; second for light to traverse a known distance. The 'true' value is
;; now considered to be 33.02.
