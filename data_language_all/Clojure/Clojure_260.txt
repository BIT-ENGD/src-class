  "A sequential consistency test.

  Verify that client order is consistent with DB order by performing queries
  (in four distinct transactions) like

  A: insert x
  A: insert y
  B: read y
  B: read x

  A's process order enforces that x must be visible before y, so we should
  always read both or neither.

  Splits keys up onto different tables to make sure they fall in different
  shard ranges"
