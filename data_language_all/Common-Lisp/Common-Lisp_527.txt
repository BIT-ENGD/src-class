;;; This :AROUND method on SHARED-INITIALIZE is meant to implement the
;;; generic-function initialization protocol as described in the AMOP.
;;; We define a trivial version that trampolines to an ordinary
;;; function.  That way, during bootstrapping we can have the ordinary
;;; function executed by the host and we can define special-purpose
;;; versions of this :AROUND method.  Notice that the function
;;; CALL-NEXT-METHOD is passed as an additional argument to the
;;; ordinary function.  This is also the case of the function
;;; INVALIDATE-DISCRIMINATING-FUNCTION.  This way, the ordinary
;;; function does not have to refer to a globally defined function.
