   objects into non-collected storage. ROOT-STRUCTURES is an optional list of
   objects which should be copied first to maximize locality.

   DEFSTRUCT structures defined with the (:PURE T) option are moved into
   read-only storage, further reducing GC cost. List and vector slots of pure
   structures are also moved into read-only storage.
