;;; immediately, because they occur synchonously (hence the boolean flag
;;; SYNCHRONOUS to this function), luckily implying that the signal
;;; happens only in specific places (illegal instructions, floating
;;; point instructions, certain system calls), hopefully ruling out the
;;; possibility that we would trigger it during allocation.
