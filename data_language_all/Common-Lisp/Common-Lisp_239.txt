  ;; +CHAR-ATTR-CONSTITUENT+.

  ;; Element type to use when reading a string literal with no extended-chars.
  ;; The system itself prefers base-string, but otherwise it is a contentious
  ;; issue. We don't (by default) use base-strings, because people often write:
  ;;   (SETF (CHAR (READ-STRING S) 0) #\PILE_OF_POO),
  ;; or more likely, something the effect of which resembles
  ;;   (SETF (CHAR (ADJUST-ARRAY "" 10) 0) #\SMILE)
  ;; which are each dubious constructs, because they assume READ to produce
  ;; strings capable of holding any char. The latter further assumes something
  ;; about compilation, because in that example, considering that there are no
  ;; characters in the literal, it is unclear whether the array should
  ;; be similar-as-constant to an array of base-char or array of character.
  ;; While indeed SBCL prints base-strings readably (if *PRINT-READABLY* is T)
  ;; using #. syntax, the question is what the writer of the code intended
  ;; if (s)he did not know that the string should have been expressly
  ;; specified via #.(MAKE-STRING ... :ELEMENT-TYPE) or somesuch.
