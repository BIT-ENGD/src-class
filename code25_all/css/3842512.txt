    <h4>Founder / Chief Executive Officer</h4>          
    <p>Eric founded Moving Simplified in 2007 as a professional services company with a new concept to assist people during one of the most stressful times of their lives:  moving.  His vision was to build a new type of moving services company - a company that would include every service that a customer would need during their move.  Bringing it all together in one company offering is the key differentiating factor with Moving Simplified.  "We are changing the face and perception of the moving company stereotype one move at a time," says Snider.  "We do this everyday by holding ourselves to a higher standard of service, people skills and performance."</p>
