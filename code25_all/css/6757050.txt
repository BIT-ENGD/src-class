A Substantially Tax Deductible Home Improves Your Wealth & Lifestyle!</h1></div>
<div align="justify" style="font-size: medium; color: #333399; font-family: helvetica">
<p>Deduct Your Home provides fresh thinking that's vastly superior in many ways to anything your financial planner, finance broker, stock broker, bank, real estate agent, lawyer &amp; accountant have ever put on the table or could hope to devise and perfect anytime soon!</p>
<p>It shreds debt fast saving you tens to hundreds of thousands in mortgage interest!</p>
<p>It smashes tens of thousands or more from your annual assessable income by legally claiming a huge proportion of your home mortgage interest, council and water rates &amp; building insurance and even lets you claim depreciation on your home!</p>
<p>It sends capital gains tax packing if you later sell your home at a profit (here’s hoping when the time comes)!</p>
<p>It’s often cash-flow positive within mere months leaving the rest of your life to soak it up!</p>

<h1 align="center" style="line-height: 26px">
Checked & Approved By The Authorities!
</h1></div>
<div align="justify" style="font-size: medium; color: #333399; font-family: helvetica">

Our system, products and services have been extensively examined and approved by each of  the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, the Australian Taxation Office &amp; the Tax Practitioners Board to the extent they've respectively confirmed we’re not operating an unlicensed financial services business, promoting illegal tax exploitation schemes or providing unregistered tax agent services!</p>
<p>Furthermore, in response to our correspondence to The Federal Treasurer (in seeking certainty for our clients), we requested that he  discuss our home business proposals with the Federal Commissioner of Taxation and to kindly get back to us with any concerns etc and where we have since been twice informed in writing by his office, that in speaking, the Commissioner said our clients can obtain the Government's protection regarding their tax affairs by way of applying for a private tax ruling as based on our home business proposal. Ladies and gentlemen, this is as good as it gets - period. Accordingly, you can now tap into our exclusive intellectual property (IP), confidential information or know-how (it's all the same thing), to achieve optimum, ultra-safe outcomes on this basis and that noone can compete with or deny.

</p><p>

We further take this opportunity to thank the ATO for respecting our claim of ownership in the IP in NOT having published any details into the public domain as would otherwise normally have occurred under the circumstances in which the relevant taxation officers were made aware. 

</p><p>

Of note, BetterLifePanel®, a related entity of our parent company, is Australia’s sole training provider to progressive accountants, registered tax agents, lawyers and financial planers, regarding proprietary and highly advanced, adviser training and client management systems on these same cutting-edge processes. Accordingly, once we have assisted you to secure your own tax ruling, we can point you towards qualified and suitably trained, professionals to assist you into the future with these and other matters!

</p><p>

The bottom line is we'll help you to obtain written ATO confirmation on your circumstances that the sorts of things we'll discuss with you are true and proper etc!</p>

Now that's safe!

<p>John earns $120,000 p.a in his job.</p>
<p>He lives in a nice home that's worth around $1,000,000 with a mortgage of $600,000 @ say 8% interest (long-term average).</p>
<p>He can likely restructure himself to attain deductions of around $50,000 p.a. that he can use to offset his wage and salary income going forward  thus saving him around $18,500 p.a in tax (medicare levy excluded).</p>
<p>He can also pay no capital gains tax in future should he hopefully sell his property for a profit.</p>
