<p style="font-size: 200%">The Sun is a star located at the centre of our solar system. It is
classified as a G2 star, has a mass of about 2Ã—1030 kg, a temperature of
5800 K at the surface and a core temperature of 15.6 million Kelvin. It
constantly emits electromagnetic radiation over the entire spectrum
(indeed, it can be modelled as a black body), peaked at the wavelength
corresponding to that of green light.</p>
