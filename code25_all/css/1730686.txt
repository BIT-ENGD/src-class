<blockquote><span>
"The worst part of writing fiction is the fear of wasting your life behind a keyboard. The idea that, dying, you'll realize that you only ever lived on paper. Your only adventures were make-believe, and while the world fought and kissed, you sat in some dark room, masturbating and making money."<br /><br /><b><div align="right">- Chuck Palahniuk</div></b>
