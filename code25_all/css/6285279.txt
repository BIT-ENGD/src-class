DEFINITIONS:
BRWS = (width of the browser window, not a variable)
BODY = (width of the document's body)
LRMG = (width of the document's left and right margins)
HSCR = (range of the browser window's horizontal scroll bar)

OBJECTIVE:
MIN HSCR   /* Third requirement */

CONSTRAINTS:
HSCR = BODY + 2*LRMG - BRWS  /* From the definition of how a browser's
                              * horizontal scrollbar works. */
BODY >= 60  /* First requirement */
LRMG <= 3   /* Second requirement */
LRMG >= 0   /* Physical constraint, margins cannot be negative */
HSCR >= 0   /* Physical constraint, scroll bars cannot have negative ranges */

BODY = (BRWS <= 66) ? 60 : (BRWS - 6)
HSCR = (BRWS >= 60) ?  0 : (60 - BRWS)
LRMG = (BRWS + HSCR - BODY) / 2
