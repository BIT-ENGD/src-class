    (in pseudo)
    for each item in excludelist
        append to string: | grep -v $item

    for each file in directory 
    do
        stuff
    done

   (in real code, the creation and concatenation of f works, the problem is not here I believe)
   for i in $EXCLUDE
   do
       echo $i
       f="$f | grep -v $i"
   done

   for d in `ls $AWSTATSCONF/awstats*conf $f`
   do
       echo $d
   done

   ls: |: No such file or directory
   ls: grep: No such file or directory
