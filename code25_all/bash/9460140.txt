gpg: C042XXXX: There is no assurance this key belongs to the named user

pub  40XXX/C042XXXX 2012-01-11 Name LastName. (comment) <user@email.com>

      Subkey fingerprint: XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX

It is NOT certain that the key belongs to the person named

you may answer the next question with yes.

Use this key anyway? (y/N)
