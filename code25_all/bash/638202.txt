 Submitting jobs from standard input
       To submit a PBS job by typing job specifications at the command line, the user types

              qsub [options] <return>

       then types any directives, then any tasks, followed by

              (in UNIX)     CTRL-D on a line by itself
              (in Windows)  CTRL-Z <return>

       to terminate the input.

for i in path/*.txt; do echo "$i";  qsub [RETURN] /path2/mycode $i; [CTRL-D]; done
