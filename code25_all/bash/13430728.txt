#!/bin/bash
# Bash commands go here

/usr/bin/expect - << EndMark
This is the expect script
expect commands go here
and here
until:
EndMark

# More bash commands go here.

exit 0

eg - Start expect script
   - At a certain point leave the expect to bash operations
   - return to the same expect script?
