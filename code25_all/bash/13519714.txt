  # The **variable slicing** notation in the following conditional
  # needs some explanation: `${var#expr}` returns everything after
  # the match for 'expr' in the variable value (if any), and
  # `${var%expr}` returns everything that doesn't match (in this
  # case, just the very first character. You can also do this in
  # Bash with `${var:0:1}`, and you could use cut too: `cut -c1`.
