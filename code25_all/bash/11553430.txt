mkdir foo/bar - this works
mkdir foo/bar/baz - this fails

mkdir -p foo/bar/baz - which didn't work, it ended up creating a '-p' directory

#!/bin/bash
DIRECTORY="foo/bar/baz"
FILE="test.pdf"         
HOST="testserver"           
USER="test"         
PASS="test"         

ftp -n $HOST <<END_SCRIPT
quote USER $USER
quote PASS $PASS
mkdir $DIRECTORY
cd $DIRECTORY
binary
put $FILE
quit
END_SCRIPT
