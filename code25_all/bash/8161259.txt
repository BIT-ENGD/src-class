# Change MYPATH to the path where you have the project
find MYPATH -name *.jpg -exec basename {} \; > /tmp/patterns
find MYPATH -name *.png -exec basename {} \; >> /tmp/patterns
find MYPATH -name *.gif -exec basename {} \; >> /tmp/patterns

# Print a list of lines that reference these files
# The cat command simply removes coloring
grep -Rf /tmp/patterns MYPATH | cat

# great -- but how do I print the lines of /tmp/patterns *NOT* listed in any given
# *.php, *.css, or *.html?
