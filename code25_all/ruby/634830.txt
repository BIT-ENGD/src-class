# now if I want to get the HTML source of this page, I can't use the IE class 
# because it doesn't have a method which supports that

# the PageContainer class, does have a method that supports that
# I'll continue what I want to do in pseudo code

Store HTML source in text file

# I know how to write to a file, so that's not a problem;
# retrieving the HTML is the problem.
# more specifically, using another Watir class is the problem.

Close browser
