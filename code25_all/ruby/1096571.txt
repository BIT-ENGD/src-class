./cruise start

DATA_ROOT = ARGV[0]
RAILS_ROOT = File.expand_path(".")     
if File.directory? 'projects'          
  #mv 'projects', DATA_ROOT + '/projects'  #comment out this line, it will work perfect fine
else
  mkdir_p DATA_ROOT + '/projects'
end

mv 'projects', DATA_ROOT + '/projects' would become 
mv ~/.cruise/projects ~/.cruise/projects which is obvious not correct
