    it "maps #edit" do
      route_for(:controller => "phones", :action => "edit", :id => "1").should == "/phones/1/edit"
    end #THIS TEST PASSES

    put :update, :id => "1", :phone => {}
    response.should redirect_to :controller => 'phones', :action => 'edit'

expected redirect to {:controller=>"phones", :action=>"edit"},
got redirect to "http://test.host/phones/1089/edit" # BUT THIS THE URL I WAS EXPECTING!
