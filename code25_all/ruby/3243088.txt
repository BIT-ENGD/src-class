You must now finish the install manually:
1) Place the folowing line at the end of your shell's loading files(.bashrc or .bash_profile for bash and .zshrc for zsh), after all path/variable settings:
     [[ -s $HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm ]] && source $HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm
   Please note that this must only occur once - so, you only need to add it the first time you install rvm.
2) Ensure that there is no 'return' from inside the .bashrc file. (otherwise rvm will be prevented from working properly).
   This means that if you see '[ -z  ] && return' then you must change this line to:
   if [[ ! -z  ]] ; then
     ... original content that was below the && return line ...
   fi # <= be sure to close the if.
   #EOF .bashrc
   Be absolutely *sure* to REMOVE the '&& return'.
   If you wish to DRY up your config you can 'source ~/.bashrc' at the bottom of your .bash_profile.
   placing all non-interactive items in the .bashrc, including the 'source' line above
3) Then CLOSE THIS SHELL and open a new one in order to use rvm.
[ -z "$PS1" ] && return


WARNING:  you have a 'return' statement in your .bashrc, likely this will cause untold havoc.
   This means that if you see '[ -z $PS1 ] && return' then you must change this line to:
   if [[ -n $PS1 ]] ; then
     ... original content that was below the && return line ...
   fi # <= be sure to close the if.
   #EOF .bashrc
Even if you use zsh you should still adjust the .bashrc as above.
If you have any questions about this please visit #rvm on irc.freenode.net.

Installation of RVM to /home/kapplej/.rvm/ is complete.
