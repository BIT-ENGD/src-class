test: on CREATE to :user with completely invalid email should respond with 
  redirect
(UsersControllerTest):ActionController::RedirectBackError: 
  No HTTP_REFERER was set in the request to this action, 
  so redirect_to :back could not be called successfully. 
If this is a test, make sure to specify request.env["HTTP_REFERER"].
