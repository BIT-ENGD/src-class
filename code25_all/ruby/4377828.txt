  Scenario: Creating a print from an existing document
    Given I am logged in as "foo@localhost.localdomain"
      And I have already built a document
     When I POST /api/prints with data:
       """
       {
         "documentId":"#{@document.id}",
         "foo":"bar",
         "etc":"etc" 
       }
       """
     Then check things
