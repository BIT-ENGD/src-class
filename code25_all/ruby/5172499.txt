Scenario Outline: All gamma features are ready
  Given feature <f> is part of the gamma release
  When I try to use feature <f>
  Then feature <f> should just work

  Scenarios:
    | f |
    | X |
    | Y |
    | Z |

Then /feature (\S*) should just work/ do |f|
   `cucumber -t@#{f}`  # except less repetitive and more awesome
end
