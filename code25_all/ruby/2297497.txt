Given I have a rails app
And I'm using cucumber
And I'm using capybara
And I have an action that results in a redirect_to "http://some.other.domain.com/some_path"
When I test this action
Then the in-app portion of the test works fine
But I see this error: No route matches "/some_path" with {:method=>:get} (ActionController::RoutingError)
