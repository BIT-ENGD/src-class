Scenario: I should be able to edit a user
  Given I created a user with the login "test@example.com"
  And I am viewing the user with login "test@example.com"
  Then I should see "Edit this user"
  When I click "Edit this user"
  Then I should be editing the user with login "test@example.com"
  When I press "Update"
  Then I should be viewing the user with login "test@example.com"
  And I should see "User was successfully updated."

Then I should be editing the user with login "test@example.com"

Then I should be viewing the user with login "test@example.com"
