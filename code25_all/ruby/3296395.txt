<%# domain gets its value from Facter, lets assume it to be abc.def.com
x,y,z=<%= domain.split(".").join(",")%>

<%# x,y and z get the values abc,def,com respectively, right ?

 <%# these don't work:
    major = <%= x %>
    minor= <%= y %>
    major = #{x}
    minor=$x

<%# I need something like this (yup, guessed it right, I am trying to generate slapd.conf      
dc=abc,dc=def,dc=com
