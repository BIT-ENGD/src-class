class ArrayMine < Array

  def join( sep = $,, format = "%s" )

    collect do |item|
      sprintf( format, item )
    end.join( sep )
  end

end

=> rooms = ArrayMine[3, 4, 6]    #i couldn't understand how this line works

print "We have " + rooms.join( ", ", "%d bed" ) + " rooms available."

    thank you...
