Given the file "extra1.txt" contains:
"""
extra1
"""

And the file "file.txt" contains:
"""
file
"""

And SVN holds the following files at revisions:
| tests/extras/extra1.txt    | 123 | extra1.txt |
| tests/path/part05/file.txt | 73  | file.txt   |

When I run "ruby dry_run_create c:\tests\path\part05\file.txt"

Then the file "c:\tests\path\part05\dry_run\extra1.txt" should contain:
"""
extra1
"""

And the file "c:\tests\path\part05\dry_run\file.txt" should contain:
"""
file
"""
