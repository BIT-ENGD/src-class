o.instance_eval("@x") # Return the value of o's instance variable @x

# Define an instance method len of String to return string length
String.class_eval("def len; size; end")

# Here's another way to do that
# The quoted code behaves just as if it was inside "class String" and "end"
String.class_eval("alias len size")

# Use instance_eval to define class method String.empty
# Note that quotes within quotes get a little tricky...
String.instance_eval("def empty; ''; end")
