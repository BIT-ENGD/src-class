  Scenario Outline: Create a user with another user
    Given I want to create a user as a user "<user>"
    When I create a user with name "<name>"
    And the user's age is "<age>"
    Then then the response should be "<response>"

Scenarios: Create user with 3 args
  | user  | name            | age              | response                    |
  | bob   |  joe            | 25               | <some_xml_response>         |

Given /^I want to create a user with another user "([^"]*)"$/ do |user|
  @reqxml << "<user><creator>#{user}</creator>"
end

When /^I create a user with name "([^"]*)"$/ do |name|
  @reqxml << "<name>#{name}</name>
end

And /^the user's age is "([^"]*)"$/ do |age|
  @reqxml << "<age>#{age}</age>"
end

Then /^then the response should be "([^"]*)"$/ do |response|
 # ?? not sure if I can use rspec :post here?
end
