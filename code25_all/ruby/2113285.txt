Feature: Describing a task
  In order to work with tasks
  As a user
  I want to be able to know what makes up a task and to improve my understanding of ActiveRecord


Scenario: A task has certain core fields
  Given the following tasks exist
  | id | name      |
  | 1  | some task |
  And the following estimates exist
  | task_id | hours | explanation                           |
  | 1       | 8     | initial estimate                      |
  | 1       | 6     | better undertsanding of task          |
  | 1       | 16    | no control over inputs to create task |
  | 2       | 22    | for other task |

Then a task: "task" should exist with name: "some task" #this works
Then the estimate "estimate" should exist with explanation: "initial estimate" #this works
Then the estimate "estimate" should be one of task: "task"'s estimates #this works
Then the task "task" should have 3 estimates  #this one fails

class Estimate < ActiveRecord::Base

  belongs_to :Task, :class_name => "Task", :foreign_key => "Task_id"

end

class Task < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :estimates
end
