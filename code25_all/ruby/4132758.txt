Scenario: Order of the events should be Ascending
    Given I am signed into an account called "Gorilla Tech" as a customer
    When I follow "Register"
    And I follow "Events"
    And I follow "Register new event"
    Then I should see the header "Use the form below to register a new event"
    And I fill in "Title" with "Apefest 2010"
    And I fill in "Event at" with "2010-01-07"
    And I fill in "Add a note" with "This was truly awesome"
    Then I press "Create"
    Then I follow "Register new event"
    And I fill in "Title" with "Monkeyfest 2010"
    And I fill in "Event at" with "2010-01-08"
    And I fill in "Add a note" with "Yeah"
    Then "Apefest 2010" should appear before "Monkeyfest 2010"



   Then /"(.*)" should appear before "(.*)"/ do |first_example, second_example|
     response.body.should =~ /#{first_example}.*#{second_example}/
   end

<div id="feeds">
    <table>
      <caption><%= t('events.all') %></caption>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th><%= Event.t(:title) %></th>
          <th><%= Event.t(:event_at) %></th>
          <th></th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <%= render :partial => 'event', :collection => @events %>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>

  <%= will_paginate(@events) %>
