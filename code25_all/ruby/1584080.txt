This is a spectacular open plan 1000 sq. ft. loft is in a former Canada Post building. Upon entering the loft from the hallway you are amazed at where you have arrived.... a stunning, bright and fully renovated apartment that retains its industrial feel. The restoration of the interior was planned and designed by a famous Vancouver architect.
The loft is above a police station, so youÂre guaranteed peace and quite at any time of the day or night.
The neighborhood is safe and lively with plenty of restaurants and shopping. ThereÂs a starbucks across the street and plenty of other coffee shops in the area.  Antique alley with its hidden treasures is one block away, as well as the beautiful mile long boardwalk. Skytrain station is one minute away (literally couple of buildings away). 15 minutes to Commercial drive, 20 minutes to downtown Vancouver and Olympic venues.
