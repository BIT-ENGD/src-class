    Given the following books exist:
  | title               | author            | year_published | votes | created_at        |
  | Lord of the Flies   | William Golding   | 1954           | 18    | January 12, 2010  |
  | The Virgin Suicides | Jeffrey Eugenides | 1993           | 12    | February 15, 2010 |
  | Island              | Richard Laymon    | 1991           | 6     | November 22, 2009 |
And the book "Lord of the Flies" is the current book of the month
And the date is "February 24, 2010"
Then the book "Lord of the Flies" should be the current book of the month
When the date is "March 1, 2010"
And I am on the home page
Then I should see "This Month's Book of the Month Club Book"
And I should see "The Virgin Suicides"
And the book "The Virgin Suicides" should be the current book of the month
And the book "Lord of the Flies" should not be the current book of the month
And the book "Island" should not be the current book of the month
