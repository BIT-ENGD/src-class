Image::Magick
Installation - Win32 Strawberry perl

    On Win32 Strawberry Perl the preferred way of installing PerlMagick is the
    following:

    1) Download and install ImageMagick Windows binaries from
    http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php#windows

    2) You HAVE TO choose dynamic (DLL) ImageMagick binaries.  Note: it is not
    possible to mix 32/64bit binaries of Perl and ImageMagick

    3) During installation select that you want to install ImageMagick's
    development files (libraries+headers)

    4) You NEED TO have ImageMagick's directory in your PATH.  Note: we are
    checking the presence of convert.exe or identify.exe tools

    5) You might need Visual C++ Redistributable Package installed on your
    system. See instructions on ImageMagick's Binary Release webpage.

    6) If you have all prerequisites 1)...5) you can simply install
    ImageMagick by running: cpan -i Image::Magick
