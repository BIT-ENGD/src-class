# 0722, as all process will be execute under apache account. Hence, they will all having '7' privilege.
my $sem = new IPC::Semaphore(10023, 1, 0722 | IPC_CREAT); # Code(1)
# Set 0th (one and only one) semaphore's value to 1, As I want to use this semaphore as mutex.
$sem->setval(0, 1);                                       # Code(2)
