You appear to lack the pcap(3) library. 

If it is installed in a non-standard locatio n, please try setting the LIBS 
and INC values on the command line.

Or get the sources and install the pcap library from http://www.tcpdump.org/

If you install the pcap library using a system package, make sure to also 
install the corresponding -devel package, which contains the C headers needed 
to compile this module.
