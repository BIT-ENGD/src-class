sub output_detail {
    Here I want to be able to access each record by the key name (ex. "first", "second", etc)
}

sub output_records {
    I want to use a foreach to pass each record has reference to another sub-routine
    that handles each record.

    foreach $key ( sort( keys %someting) ) {
        output_detail(something);
    }
}

%records = ();

while ($recnum, $first, $second, $third) = db_read($handle)) {
    my %rec = ("first"=>$first, "second"=>$second, "third=>$third);
    my $id = $recnum;
    $records{$id} = \%rec;
}

output_records(\%records);
