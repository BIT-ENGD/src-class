no conflicting prior mod_perl version found - good.

Next we need to know where the 'apxs' script is located. This script
provides a lot of information about the Apache installation, and makes
it easier to find things on your system. Normally it's located in the
same directory as the 'httpd' executable.

If you don't yet have Apache installed you can build Apache against
the Apache source code, but you won't be able to run the test suite (a
very important step). Therefore you may want to install Apache before
proceeding.


Please provide a full path to 'apxs' executable
(press Enter if you don't have it installed):


Please provide the location of the Apache directory:  C:\Program Files\Apache So
ftware Foundation\Apache2.2
[  error] Unable to open C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.2/a
p_release.h: No such file or directory
[  error] Unable to determine server version, aborting.
[  error] Please specify MP_APXS or MP_AP_PREFIX.
