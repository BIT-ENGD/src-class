PROCESS TERMINATED DUE TO ERRORS

File::Util can't use this string for �the name of a directory�.
   �ddd??---?d�
It contains illegal characters.

Illegal characters are:
   \   (backslash)
   /   (forward slash)
   :   (colon)
   |   (pipe)
   *   (asterisk)
   ?   (question mark)
   "   (double quote)
   <   (less than)
   >   (greater than)
   \t  (tab)
   \ck (vertical tabulator)
   \r  (newline CR)
   \n  (newline LF)

Origin:     This is a human error.
Solution:   A human must remove the illegal characters from this string.
