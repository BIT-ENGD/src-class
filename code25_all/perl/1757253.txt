Write a simple command-line script probably under 100 lines
that supports these actions:

  - create a specified svn branch
  - create a specified svn tag.  (Possibly deducing tag location
    by swapping "trunk" with "tags".)

support svn 1.6 repository or later

Script to be invoked on the svn server for speed and per current
"in house" policy.

I have been asked to use a library approach, instead of directly
calling (for ex) 'svn copy', because of the value that may added
by the library method, and because the script may be easier to
maintain and extend.
