*** WHOA THERE!!! ***

    This is an UNSTABLE DEVELOPMENT release.
    The version of this perl5 distribution is 9, that is, odd,
    (as opposed to even) and that signifies a development release.
    If you want a maintenance release, you want an even-numbered version.

    Do ***NOT*** install this into production use.
    Data corruption and crashes are possible.

    It is most seriously suggested that you do not continue any further
    unless you want to help in developing and debugging Perl.

    If you *still* want to build perl, you can answer 'y' now,
    or pass -Dusedevel to Configure.
