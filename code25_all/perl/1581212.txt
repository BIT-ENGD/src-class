  CPAN.pm: Going to build J/JA/JASONS/XML-Xerces-2.7.0-0.tar.gz


   WARNING

You have not defined any of the following environment variables:
   XERCESCROOT
   XERCES_LIB
   XERCES_INCLUDE

These instruct me how to locate the Xerces header files, and the
Xerces dynamic library. If they are installed in a standard system
directory, I will located them without those variables.

However, if they have been installed in a non-standard location
(e.g. '/usr/include/xerces'), then I will need help. See the README
for more info.

Proceeding ...

   WARNING

You have not defined any of the following environment variables:
   XERCESCROOT
   XERCES_CONFIG

Without these I cannot find the config.status file that was used to
build your Xerces-C library. Without that file, I may not be able to properly
build the C++ glue files that come with Xerces.pm.

Proceeding anyway ...

      *** Version Mismatch ***

You are attempt to build XML::Xerces-2.7.0-0 using Xerces-C-2.8.0,
this will most likely fail, so I am aborting.

You must use Xerces-C-2.7.0
