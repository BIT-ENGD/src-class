Installing /Users/wuzl/perl5/perlbrew/build/perl-5.14.2 failed.
See /Users/wuzl/perl5/perlbrew/build.log to see why.
If you want to force install the distribution, try:

  perlbrew --force install perl-5.14.2

I can't find make or gmake, and my life depends on it.
Go find a public domain implementation or fix your PATH setting!
