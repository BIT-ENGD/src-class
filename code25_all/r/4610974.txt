acq <- "This paper describes a novel optical thread plug
gauge (OTPG) for internal thread inspection using machine
vision. The OTPG is composed of a rigid industrial
endoscope, a charge-coupled device camera, and a two
degree-of-freedom motion control unit. A sequence of
partial wall images of an internal thread are retrieved and
reconstructed into a 2D unwrapped image. Then, a digital
image processing and classification procedure is used to
normalize, segment, and determine the quality of the
internal thread."
