# A normal, plain-jane call to grid.arrange is fine for displaying all my plots
grid.arrange(x, y, z)

# But, for my purposes, I need a 2 x 2 layout. So the command below works acceptably.
grid.arrange(x, y, z, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)

# The problem is that the function I'm developing outputs a LIST of an arbitrary
# number plots, and I'd like to be able to plot every plot in the list on a 2 x 2
# laid-out page. I can at least plot a list of plots by constructing a do.call()
# expression, below. (Note: it totally even surprises me that this do.call expression
# DOES work. I'm astounded.)
plot.list <- list(x, y, z)
do.call(grid.arrange, plot.list)

# But now I need 2 x 2 pages. No problem, right? Since do.call() is taking a list of
# arguments, I'll just add my grid.layout arguments to the list. Since grid.arrange is
# supposed to pass layout arguments along to grid.layout anyway, this should work.
args.list <- c(plot.list, "nrow = 2", "ncol = 2")

# Except that the line below is going to fail, producing an "input must be grobs!"
# error
