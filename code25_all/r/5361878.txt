# algorithm for getting entry prices (when signal > 0): look back from current
# position until you find first signal > 0,
# `mktdataclose` at that time is entry price
# `entryPrices` is an xts object representing entry prices
# if entryPrices are not available (is.null == TRUE) then wee need to reconstruct
# them from signal (xts object with 1 when entry signal triggered and 0 
# otherwise) and close prices available in mktdataclose (an xts object with the
# same length as signal and same dates just that it represents closing prices)

EntryPrices <- entryPrices
if (is.null(EntryPrices)) {
    # get entryprices as close prices on buy signal
    EntryPrices <- ifelse(signal > 0, mktdataclose, 0)
    entryPrice <- 0
    for (i in 1:NROW(signal)) {
        if (signal[i] > 0) entryPrice <- mktdataclose[i]
        EntryPrices[i] <- entryPrice
    }
}
