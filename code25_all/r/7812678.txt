# Method would recognize that there is no class 'URL_something.com' 
# yet and thus create it:
setRefClass(Class="URL_something.com", contains="URL")

# Another method would take care of mapping field values to 
# an instance of the new class:
> url.obj <- new("URL_something.com", x="http://www.something.com/home/index.html")
> inherits(url.obj, "URL")
[1] TRUE

> obj$url <- url.obj
> class(obj$url)
[1] "URL"
# So I lose the information that it was actually of class "URL_something.com"
