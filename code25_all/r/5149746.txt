    Error in gzfile(file, "wb") : unable to open connection
     In addition: Warning message:
     In gzfile(file, "wb") :
       cannot open compressed file '.RDataTmp',
       probable reason 'Permission denied'
 The defaults were changed to use compressed saves for 'save' in
 2.3.0 and for 'save.image' in 2.4.0.  Any recent version of R can
 read compressed save files, and a compressed file can be
 uncompressed (by 'gzip -d') for use with very old versions of R.*
