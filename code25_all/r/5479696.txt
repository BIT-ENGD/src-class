Hello , i came up with an idea , but i need your help to do it.
first the data is in a large text file and i will upload it if you want , my idea is : create a function that take 2 argument : 
1.the name of the column which should be used for grouping the data (e.g. phylum, or class)
2. the name of the column containing the data to test (e.g. A,C,G,T)
and i will test the data for each phylum first , and if i want i will test it for each class in each phylum.
that's mean,i will take the A column for first phylum and A column for 2nd phylum and make the wilcox.test on them ,  and i will make the process for each common column in each phylum. and then i will use a subset function to test the classes inside each phylum.  
give me your opininon with this ??
