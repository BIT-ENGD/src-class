* Import
  - I want org-mode to ignore import-sql.
#+srcname: import-data
#+begin_src R :exports none :noweb yes
<<import-csv>>
#+end_src

#+srcname: import-csv
#+begin_src R :exports none
data <- read.csv("foo-clean.csv")
#+end_src

#+srcname: import-sql
#+begin_src R :exports none
library(RSQLite)
blah blah blah
#+end_src

* Clean
  - This is run on foo.csv, producing foo-clean.csv
  - Fixes the mess of -9 and -13 to NA for my sanity.
  - This only needs to be run once, and after that, reference.
  - How can I tell org-mode to skip this?
#+srcname: clean-csv
#+begin_src sh :exports none
sed .....
#+end_src

* Explore

** Explore by a factor (1)
   - Dead end. Did not pan out. Ignore.
   - Produces a couple of charts showing there is not interaction.
#+srcname: explore-by-a-factor-1
#+begin_src R :exports none :noweb yes
#+end_src

** Explore by a factor (2)
   - A useful exploration that I will reference later in a report.
   - Produces a couple of charts showing the interaction of my variables.
#+srcname: explore-by-a-factor-2
#+begin_src R :exports none :noweb yes
#+end_src
