Individual "A", has both parents unknown so will get score 0
Indiviudal "C", has both parents known (i.e. A, B) 
will get 0 score (maximum of their parents) 

Indvidual Parent1 Parent2   Scores     Explanation 
1         A    <NA>    <NA>    0       0 (Max of parent Scores NA) + 0 (neither parent knwon) 
2         B    <NA>    <NA>    0       0 (Max of parent Scores NA)  + 0 (neither parent knwon) 
3         C     A       B      1    0 (Max of parent Scores)  +  1 (either parent knwon)       
4         D     A        C      2       1 (Max of parent scores)  +  1 (either parent knwon) 
5         E       C      D      3       2 (Max of parent scores) + 1 (either parent knwon)
6         F       C      D      3       2 (Max of parent scores) + 1 (either parent knwon)
7         G       C      D      3       2 (Max of parent scores) + 1 (either parent knwon)
8         H       E    <NA>     4       3 (Max of parent scores) + 1 (either parent knwon) 
9         I       A       D     3       2 (Max of parent scores) + 1 (either parent knwon)
10        J      <NA>    <NA>   0       0 (Max of parent scores NA)  + 0 (neither parent knwon)

Individual C has two parents A and B, each of which has Scores calculated as 0 and 0 
(in row 1 and 2 and column Scores),  means that max (c(0,0)) will be 0

Individual E has parents C and D, whose scores in Scores column is (in row 3 and 4),
 1 and 2, respectively.  So maximum of max(c(1,2)) will be 2.
