X <- "Two households, both alike in dignity, In fair Verona, where we lay
our scene, From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two
foes A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life; Whose
misadventured piteous overthrows Do with their death bury their
parents' strife. The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love, And
the continuance of their parents' rage, Which, but their children's
end, nought could remove, Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
The which if you with patient ears attend"
