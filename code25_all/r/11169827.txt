ntrt
[1] "EL1" "EL2" "EL3" "EL4"

> sample(ntrt,4)
[1] "EL4" "EL3" "EL2" "EL1" 

# is equal to:
sample(ntrt)

but what I need:
c(sample(ntrt), sample(ntrt), sample(ntrt))

[1] "EL4" "EL3" "EL1" "EL2" "EL1" "EL2" "EL3" "EL4" "EL3" "EL1" "EL2" "EL4"

which is equal to 
c(sample(ntrt,4), sample(ntrt,4), sample(ntrt,4))

# for repl = 1
sample from ntrt  size = length(ntrt)

# repeat the same process again
# for repl = 2
sample from ntrt  size = length(ntrt)
# note: I only concerned with order of names within ntrt (randomization process)

# repeat the same process again
# for repl = 3
sample from ntrt  size = length(ntrt)

same process for n levels of repl
