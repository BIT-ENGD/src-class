# Assume a data.frame called fooData
# Assume the column is the first column before transposing

# Transpose table
fooData.T <- t(fooData)

# Set the column headings
colnames(fooData.T) <- test[1,]

# Get rid of the column heading row
fooData.T <- fooData.T[2:nrow(fooData.T), ]

#fooData.T now contains a transposed table with the first column as headings
