sweep(x, MARGIN, STATS, FUN="-", check.margin=T, ...)

# x is the data
# STATS refers to the summary statistics which you wish to 'sweep out'
# FUN is the function used to carry out the sweep, "-" is the default

# e.g., use 'sweep' to express a given matrix in terms of distance from 
# the respective column mean

# create some data:
M = matrix( 1:12, ncol=3)

# calculate column-wise mean for M
dx = colMeans(M)

# now 'sweep' that summary statistic from M
sweep(M, 2, dx, FUN="-")
