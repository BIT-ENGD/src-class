Check that (1) graphviz is installed on your system; (2) the
installed version of graphviz matches '2.26.3'; this is the version
used to build this Rgraphviz package; (3) graphviz is accessible to
R, e.g., the path to the graphviz 'bin' directory is in the system
'PATH' variable.  See additional instructions in the 'README' file of
the Rgraphviz 'source' distribution, available at
