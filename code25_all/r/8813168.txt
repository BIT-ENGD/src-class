OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR HERB KOHL, CHAIRMAN

    The Chairman. Good afternoon to everybody, and thank you 
very much for coming to this hearing this afternoon.
    In today's tough economic climate, millions of seniors have 
lost a big part of their retirement and investments in only a 
matter of months. Unlike younger Americans, they do not have 
time to wait for the markets to rebound in order to recoup a 
lifetime of savings.
