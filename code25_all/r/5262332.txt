CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.14.0 patched:

[...]

o tempfile() on a Unix-alike now takes the process ID into account.
  This is needed with multicore (and as part of parallel) because
  the parent and all the children share a session temporary
  directory, and they can share the C random number stream used to
  produce the uniaue part.  Further, two children can call
  tempfile() simultaneously.
