  mdf <- data.frame (sn = 1:40, var = rep(1:10, 4), block = rep(1:4, each = 10), 
yld = c(1:40))

blockdf <- data.frame(block = 1:4, yld = c(10, 20, 30, 40)) # block means 

for example: value 10 will be substracted from all var within 
   first block yld in mdf 
                   20  -  second block yld in mdf

and so on
