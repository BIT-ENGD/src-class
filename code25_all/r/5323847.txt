## Here we have 12 samples (A-L), all of which have congruent assignments, except sample K.
## From the two group assignments, we can see that group 1 has become group 4 in class2,
## group 2 has become group 1 etc. etc.

## How do we assess cluster membership with these differing subgroup labels?

class1<-c(1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4)
class2<-c(4,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,1,3,3)

names(class1)<-LETTERS[1:12]
names(class2)<-LETTERS[1:12]
