vex amd64->IR: unhandled instruction bytes: 0x66 0xF 0x3A 0xB 0xC0 0xC
==31160== valgrind: Unrecognised instruction at address 0x399fe26990.
==31160== Your program just tried to execute an instruction that Valgrind
==31160== did not recognise.  There are two possible reasons for this.
==31160== 1. Your program has a bug and erroneously jumped to a non-code
==31160==    location.  If you are running Memcheck and you just saw a
==31160==    warning about a bad jump, it's probably your program's fault.
==31160== 2. The instruction is legitimate but Valgrind doesn't handle it,
==31160==    i.e. it's Valgrind's fault.  If you think this is the case or
==31160==    you are not sure, please let us know and we'll try to fix it.
==31160== Either way, Valgrind will now raise a SIGILL signal which will
==31160== probably kill your program.
