#Define simple function that takes a date-object and returns a date-object
add_day <- function(dat) {return(dat + 1)}

#Set up data.frame with two date-object entries in one column
df <- data.frame(Col_A = c(as.Date("01/01/00", "%m/%d/%y"), as.Date("05/02/11", "%m/%d/%y")))
#That is the desired result: give a date-object to the function, get one back
add_day(df[1, "Col_A"]) #Returns [1] "2000-01-02"
add_day(df[2, "Col_A"]) #Returns [1] "2011-05-03"

#Why does it not work here? What do I get back?
mapply(add_day, df[, "Col_A"]) #Returns [1] 10958 15097; Why? What is that?
