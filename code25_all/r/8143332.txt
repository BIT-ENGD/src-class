You're loading optmatch, by Ben Hansen, a package for flexible
and optimal matching. Important license information:
The optmatch package makes essential use of D. P. Bertsekas
and P. Tseng's RELAX-IV algorithm and code, as well as
Bertsekas' AUCTION algorithm and code.
Bertsekas and Tseng freely permit their software to be used for
research purposes, but non-research uses, including the use of it
to 'satisfy in any part commercial delivery requirements to
government or industry,' require a special agreement with them.
By extension, this requirement applies to any use of the
fullmatch() function. (If you are using another package that has
loaded optmatch, then you will probably be using fullmatch indirectly.)
