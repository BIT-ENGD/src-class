Error in file(file, "wt") : 'mode' for the clipboard must be 'r' on Unix

  'file' can also be used with 'description = "clipboard"' in mode
  '"r"' only.  It reads the X11 primary selection, which can also be
  specified as '"X11_primary"' and the secondary selection as
  '"X11_secondary"'.

  When the clipboard is opened for reading, the contents are
  immediately copied to internal storage in the connection.

  Unix users wishing to _write_ to the primary selection may be able
  to do so via 'xclip' (<URL:
  http://people.debian.org/~kims/xclip/>), for example by
  'pipe("xclip -i", "w")'.
