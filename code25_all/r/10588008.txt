There are ~100 observation stations that I'm interested in, each of which has a varying start and end date for rainfall measurements. They're formatted as above in a single data file, with stations separated by "120 (station number) (station name)".

I need first to separate this file by station, then to extract March, April, May and June for each year, then take a total of these months for each year. So far I'm messing around with loops (as below), but I understand this isn't the right way to go about it and would rather learn some better technique.
Thanks again for the help!

(Original question:)
I've got a large data set containing rainfall by season for ~100 years over 100+ locations. I'm trying to separate this data into more managable arrays, and in particular I want to retrieve the sum of the rainfall for March, April, May and June for each station for each year.
The following is a simplified version of my code so far: 

a <- array(1,dim=c(10,12))
for (i in 1:5) {

  all data:
  assign(paste("station_",i,sep=""), a)

  #march - june data:
  assign(paste("station_",i,"_mamj",sep=""), a[,4:7])
}

  #march - june data:

}

So this gives me station_(i)__mamj_ which contains the data for the months I'm interested in for each station. Now I want to sum each row of this array and enter it in a new array called station_(i)_mamj_tot. Simple enough in theory, but I can't work out how to reference station_(i)_mamj so that it varies the value of i
