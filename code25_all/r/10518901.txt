UseMethod
UseMethod
...UseMethod and NextMethod search for methods in two places: 
first in the environment in which the generic function is called, 
and then in the registration data base for the environment 
in which the generic is defined (typically a namespace)

library( xts )
as.matrix  # shows UseMethod("as.matrix")
methods("as.matrix") # shows as.matrix.xts.  * indicates non-visible
showMethods("as.matrix")  # says <not an S4 generic function>
data(sample_matrix)
as.matrix( as.xts(sample_matrix) ) # how does R find as.matrix.xts??  its not exported!

as.matrix
namespace:base
as.matrix.xts
as.matrix
as.matrix.xts
