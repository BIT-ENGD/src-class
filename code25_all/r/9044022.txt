Algorithm 5 Steepest Ascent Hill-Climbing
1: n ← number of tweaks desired to sample the gradient
2: S ← some initial candidate solution
3: repeat
4: R ← Tweak(Copy(S))
5: for n − 1 times do
6: W ← Tweak(Copy(S))
7: if Quality(W) > Quality(R) then
8: R ← W
9: if Quality(R) > Quality(S) then
10: S ← R
11: until S is the ideal solution or we have run out of time
12: return S
