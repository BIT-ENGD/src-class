Flood-fill (node, target-color, replacement-color):
     1. Set Q to the empty queue.
     2. If the color of node is not equal to target-color, return.
     3. Add node to Q.
     4. For each element n of Q:
     5.  If the color of n is equal to target-color:
     6.   Set w and e equal to n.
     7.   Move w to the west until the color of the node to the west of w no longer matches target-color.
     8.   Move e to the east until the color of the node to the east of e no longer matches target-color.
     9.   Set the color of nodes between w and e to replacement-color.
    10.   For each node n between w and e:
    11.    If the color of the node to the north of n is target-color, add that node to Q.
           If the color of the node to the south of n is target-color, add that node to Q.
    12. Continue looping until Q is exhausted.
    13. Return.
