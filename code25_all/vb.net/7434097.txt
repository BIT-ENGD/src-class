' 1. Get the WebBrowsers bitmap.

    Dim bmp As New Bitmap(WebBrowser1.Width, WebBrowser1.Height)
    Dim BMPEndResult As Bitmap
    Dim graph As Graphics = Graphics.FromImage(bmp)
    Dim p As Point = Me.PointToScreen(WebBrowser1.Location)
    graph.CopyFromScreen(p.X, p.Y, 0, 0, bmp.Size)
    picDest.Image = bmp

 - without the scrollbars if possible
 - Even if the window is minimized or in the task bar
 - Full webbrowser
 - and also if possible just a part of it, where I can specify the top, left, width and height
