What this means, almost certainly, is that the SerialPort object attempted
to complete the call to ReadLine after the port has been closed. This can
happen because of the lack of synchronization between UI events which may
cause the port to close, and the background thread in the SerialPort object
that is performing the actual ReadFile operation (this executes as a result
of ReadLine in your delegate).

The problem with ReadLine, and the reason that I DO NOT use it, is that it
blocks until the the line terminating condition occurs -- this may be well
AFTER you have closed the port. Thus the exception.

I prefer simply buffering my own data in a Static or class-level variable
(all ReadExisting and append new data to the buffer) , and testing that
buffer for the vbCrLf terminating characters. If the vbCrLf is found (InStr
or Substring, your choice), then call a delegate to process and display the
data in the buffer. Remember to clear this buffer AFTER you have processed
and displayed its content. If you do this, the exception should be
resolved.
