'In the next statement, the myC2 inside col collection will be decreased to contain
'only obj1, like myC. I supose this is for myC and myC2 contains only a pointer to
'objects obj1 and obj2 as well col contains pointers to myC and myC2
myC.remove(obj2)

'The problem is that I have to only copy myC to myC2, like a ByVal argument in a function,
'instead a ByRef argument, in order to mantain a copy of objects in myC2 while these
'objects should be removed from myC. How should I do it?
