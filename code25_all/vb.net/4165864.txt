What is the best way? Currently, I am doing this:

    Dim NovGmt As Date = New Date(2010, 11, 1, 0, 0, 0)
    Dim Nov1AsLocal As Date = GetGmtExpressedAsLocal(NovGmt)



   Private Function GetGmtExpressedAsLocal(ByVal gmtDate As Date) As Date
        Return gmtDate.AddMinutes(GetMinuteOffsetFromGmt)
    End Function

   Private Function GetMinuteOffsetFromGmt() As Double

       Dim NowTime As Date = Now
       Dim NowAsGmt As Date = NowTime.ToUniversalTime

       Return CType(DateDiff(DateInterval.Minute, NowAsGmt, NowTime), Double)

   End Function
