' Not sure how to make this work, since the CustomerID and Name would be the same, but the city, state, zip might not be.'
t = new classCustomer(CustomerID, CustomerName, City, State, Zip)
if not sr.contains(t) then
  sr.Add(t)
end if

Possibly figure out how to create an ObservableDictionary, but so far all the examples are in C#, and it may take me a while to port it over to VB.net
