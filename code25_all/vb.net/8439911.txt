Error   2   Class 'BaseContainer' must implement 'Property Form As IForm' for interface 'Common.IContainer'. Implementing property must have matching 'ReadOnly' or 'WriteOnly' specifiers.

Error   3   'Form' cannot implement 'Form' because there is no matching property on interface 'Common.IContainer'.
