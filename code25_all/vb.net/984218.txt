//This program will allow a user to input an employee name and salary
//The output will contain the mean salary 
//as well as the number of salaries above and below the mean
//
//Arrays Used:
//Name(K) = Array for employee names
//Salary(K) = Array for salaries
//
//Variables Used:
//Mean = Mean of all employees Salaries
//UpMean = Number of Employees making more than the mean
//DwnMean = Number of Employees making less than the mean
//Sum = Sum of all salaries
//CountM = Counter for Mean
//CountUp = Counter for # of salaries above mean
//CountDwn = Counter for # of salaries below mean
