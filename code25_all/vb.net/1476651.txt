     How to close the binaryreader and Stream, when reader in the middle of stream

     Using response As FtpWebResponse = CType(ftp.GetResponse, FtpWebResponse)
               Using input As Stream = response.GetResponseStream()
                        Using reader As New BinaryReader(input)
                            Try
                                Using writer As New BinaryWriter(File.Open(targetFI.FullName, FileMode.Create)) 'output)
                                    Dim buffer(2048) As Byte '= New Byte(2048)
                                    Dim count As Integer = reader.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length)
                                    While count <> 0
                                        writer.Write(buffer, 0, count)
                                        count = reader.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length)
                                   End While
                                    writer.Close()
                                End Using

                            Catch ex As Exception
                                'catch error and delete file only partially downloaded
                                targetFI.Delete()
                                'Throw

                        End Using

                        input.Close()
                    End Using
