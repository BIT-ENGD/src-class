    Dim sheetToPopulate As Excel.Worksheet = getSheet()
    Dim reader As OleDbDataReader
    Dim query As String = "SELECT * FROM dataTable"
    Dim cmd As New OleDbCommand(query, oleConn)
    Dim reader As OleDbDataReader
    oleConn.Open()
    reader = cmd.ExecuteReader()
    Do While reader.Read()
        // How use the reader to populate the sheet at once.
        // I have the sheet object as sheetToPopulate.
        // cell.Vaule = reader.GetString(0)  ' It would be very in-efficient and complex.
        // How can I dump the table to my excel sheet ?
    Loop
    reader.Close()
    oleConn.Close()

Should I use dataset of something.. ? If yes, how to proceed for that ?
