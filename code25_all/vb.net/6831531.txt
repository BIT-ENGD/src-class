Dim SmtpServer As New SmtpClient()
SmtpServer.Credentials = New Net.NetworkCredential(xInformation(0), xInformation(1))
SmtpServer.Port = CInt(xInformation(2))
SmtpServer.Host = xInformation(3) 
SmtpServer.EnableSsl = True

Dim mail As New MailMessage()
mail = New MailMessage
mail.From = New MailAddress(xInformation(4), "Display Name")
mail.CC.Add(xInformation(5))  ' i will make a loop here to add recipients
mail.Subject = xInformation(6)
mail.IsBodyHtml = True
mail.Body = xInformation(7)

SmtpServer.Send(mail)

1.) if i have to send, for instance, email to 5 recipients, and only 
        3 emails have been successfully sent, how can i know the 
        failed email addresses?
2.) where is the failed email address stored?
3.) what exceptions are needed to trapped this error?
