No Accessible 'where' can be called without narrowing conversion. Candidates are
   Public Function Where(Of Article)(IEnumerable(Of Article), Func(Of Article, Boolean)) As IEnumerable(Of Article) (In Class Enumerable)
   Public Function Where(Of Article)(IQueryable(Of Article), Expression(Of Func(Article, Boolean))) As IQueryable(Of Article) (In Class Queryable)
