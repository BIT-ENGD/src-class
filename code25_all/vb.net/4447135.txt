   Whatz wrong in this query, can any one re-edit this query to delete whole record from table1 using username from gridview cell 4 ... ?

Imports System.Data.SqlClient

     Dim con As New SqlConnection
                Dim cmd As New SqlCommand
                Try
                    con.ConnectionString = "Data Source=.\SQLEXPRESS;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|\ASPNETDB.MDF;Integrated Security=True;User Instance=True"
                    con.Open()
                    cmd.Connection = con
                    cmd.CommandText = "DELETE FROM Table1 WHERE UserName =" & GridView1.SelectedRow.Cells(4).ToString
                    cmd.ExecuteNonQuery()

                Catch ex As Exception
                    MsgBox("Error while Deleting record on table..." & ex.Message, "Delete Records")
                Finally
                    con.Close()
                End Try
