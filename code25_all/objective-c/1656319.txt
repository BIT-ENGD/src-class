- (IBAction)btnTouchDown:(id)sender
{
  // how can you identify the button here,
  // if several different buttons map
  // their "Touch" event to this same function?
  // I know you can look at its text but that seems really clumsy
  // can I somehow get its INTERFACE BUILDER NAME?

  // I named each uniquely in interface builder,
  // under "Identity"/"Name"
  // Or is my only recourse to tie EACH BUTTON to its own handler function?
