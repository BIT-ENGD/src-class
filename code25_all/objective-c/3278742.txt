// The following line I have debugged and it does in fact go to my app delegate, wherein it instantiates a MOC (since this is the first place in the code that it's used..), and returns it, and it appears to also be setting it via the property in My_WindowController
[Window1_WindowController setManagedObjectContext:[AppDelegate managedObjectContext]];

// The following is where I get my problem, this does load my window but in my gdb window I see the runtime error message that I list at the top of this post 
NSWindow *window1Pointer = [Window1_WindowController window];
