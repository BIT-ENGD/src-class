/*
Determining when the last finger in a multi-touch sequence has lifted
When you want to know when the last finger in a multi-touch sequence is lifted
from a view, compare the number of UITouch objects in the passed in set with the
number of touches for the view maintained by the passed-in UIEvent object.
For example:
*/

- (void) touchesEnded:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event {
        if ([touches count] == [[event touchesForView:self] count]) {
            // last finger has lifted....
        }
    }

passing argument 1 of 'touchesForView:' from distinct Objective-C type
