foreach (photoNeedsUpload in users photos)

       upload the photo via Upload Script

callback hook: successOrFailureUploading (called back by the Upload Script)

    1. Do the upload and then wait for NSURLRequest callbacks: 

    connectionDidFinishLoading, didFailWithError, etc., etc.

    2. Upon getting called back, in turn:
call back Script One appropriately with success/failure signal
