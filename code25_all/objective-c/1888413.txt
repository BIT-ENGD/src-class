m working on a part of code where a label text should change value after getting a new value from a singleton class. Seems simple enough, and after testing the value it actually changes aswell, but its not updated in the view. In the view it stays the same as before. I
-(void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated
- (void)viewDidLoad {
//get the new status value
sharedBarCodeValue = [BarcodeValues sharedBarCodeValues];
if([[sharedBarCodeValue storeBarCodeValue] isEqualToString:@"123456"])
{
    [statusText setText:@"This is a new status text"];
}
//for testing, output status text
NSLog(@"status: %@", statusText.text);
[super viewDidLoad];
