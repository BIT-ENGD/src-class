The Markdown object is encouraged to be instantiated once with the required settings, and reused between parses.

Rails
application_helper.rb
Redcarpet
def markdown(text)
  options = [:hard_wrap, :filter_html, :autolink, :no_intraemphasis, :fenced_code, :gh_blockcode]
  Redcarpet.new(text, *options).to_html.html_safe
end
