This worked for a few months. Unfortunately, occasionally a test would time
out and fail after 18 seconds - maybe 1 in 100 test runs would fail with a
timeout. Normally when the tests fail you get back some kind of error message
- a Postgres constraint failure will print a useful message, or a Javascript
exception will bubble up, or Javascript will complain about an unhandled
rejection.

<p>With this error we didn't get any of those. We also observed it could happen
anywhere - it didn't seem to correlate with any individual test or test file.</p>
