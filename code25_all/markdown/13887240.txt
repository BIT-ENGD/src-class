/**
 Represents a cover image. It can be a game cover, a trophy image or even a player avatar.

 It has three properties:

 - **NSMutableString uri**: the link that points to the image.
  - E.g.: [A Skyrim trophy image URI] (http://bit.ly/skyrimTrophyImageUri ).

 - **UIImage img**: the actual image. That is, the bitmap.
  - E.g.: 1A9A3826FB6B42C1B08824655A740620BC8E75F9.PNG

 - **ResolutionType resolution**: the image resolution, which comes from an enumeration of this class called __"ResolutionType"__.
  - E.g: SEN_75x41
