Argument            | Description |
--------            | ----------- |
appDir              | The top level directory that contains your app. If this
option is used then it assumed your scripts are in |a subdirectory under this path. This option is not required. If it is not specified, then baseUrl below is the anchor point for finding things. If this option is specified, then all the files from the app directory will be copied to the dir: output area, and baseUrl will assume to be a relative path under this directory.  
baseUrl             | By default, all modules are located relative to this path. If baseUrl is not explicitly set, then all modules are loaded relative to the directory that holds the build file. If appDir is set, then baseUrl should be specified as relative to the appDir.
dir                 | The directory path to save the output. If not specified, then the path will default to be a directory called "build" as a sibling to the build file. All relative paths are relative to the build file. 
modules             | List the modules that will be optimized. All their immediate and deep dependencies will be included in the module's file when the build is done. If that module or any of its dependencies includes i18n bundles, only the root bundles will be included unless the locale: section is set above.
