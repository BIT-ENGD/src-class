I'm trying not to, kid. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't
on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this
ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent
you. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.

I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me
believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything.
