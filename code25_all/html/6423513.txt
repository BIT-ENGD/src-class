1. User arrives at page
2. User is asked to share location
3. When user says yes, Google Maps initialises and centres on their position
4. We add marker to map showing their position
5. (ongoing) As the user moves, the marker continues to move with them

// Add a marker
function addMarker(loc) { // adds marker }
function setupMap(loc) { // initialise map and centre on user's position };
setUpMap(???????);
// Start watching user's position
var watchID = navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(addMarker);

setUpMap
addMarker
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition
watchLocation
