  <flashtext><b>Interviewer:</b> Linda, could you start by describing to me what you think the basis of a well-managed classroom is. Describe in your own words, what you think the basis of a well managed classroom is? What helps you get there?</flashtext>
  <flashtext><b>Linda:</b> I think just having a well managed classroom is just having good expectations so that for the children, that they know their limits, what is expected of them, what is just being able to tell them, "Okay, this is what we're doing today.", and then just set it up for them and then they know they can accomplish it, just not having any mixed messages for them.</flashtext>
  <flashtext><b>Linda:</b> Having a well managed classroom is just having a really good curriculum that the teacher's can follow and teach the children so that they're interested and they know exactly what's expected of them and then the management comes from them just knowing what's expected of them, just setting up classroom rules and everybody being able to follow them and knowing what's expected.</flashtext>
