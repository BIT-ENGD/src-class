MFMailComposeViewController
addAttachmentData:mimeType:fileName:
<IMG border="0" style="border:0;" src="fileName.gif" >

If you want to include images with your content, 
you must attach the images separately using the 
addAttachmentData:mimeType:fileName: method.
You should call this method before you display the mail composition interface 
only. Do not call it after presenting the interface to the user.
