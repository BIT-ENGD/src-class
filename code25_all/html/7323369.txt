<!-- Why must the text that's intended to be right-justified *PRECEED*
   the text that is to be left-justified? It "feels" like the syntax should
   simply read from top to bottom:

   <div>
   "Put some text here"
   "Then put some text here, but align it right"
   </div>

   Instead, this seems to work:
   <div>
   "The right-justified text has to go first"
   "Then we code the 'normal' left-justified text"
   </div>

   I see how to 'make it work', but I'm curious as to the logic behind this
   seemingly 'backwards' syntax.  What am I misunderstanding?

<div>

   <!-- Does NOT work as intended -->
   <div>
      <p>I am on the Left</p>
   </div>

   <div style="float: right;">
      <p>I am on the RIGHT, but I don't align</p>
   </div>

   <!-- Works as intended -->
   <div style="float: right;">
      <p >I am on the RIGHT, and I mostly align</p>
   </div>

   <div>
      <p class="">I am on the Left</p>
   </div>
