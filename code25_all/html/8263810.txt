<td id="columnRight" rowspan="4"><strong>Welcome to Maidstone</strong><br>
Maidstone is the county town of Kent, England, 32 miles (51 km) south-east of London. The   River Medway runs through the centre of the town linking Maidstone to Rochester and the Thames   Estuary. Historically, the river was a source and route for much of the town's trade.   Maidstone was the centre of the agricultural county of Kent, known as the Garden of England.     There is evidence of a settlement in the area dating back to beyond the Stone Age. The town is   within the borough of Maidstone. In 2001, the town had a population of 75,070. Maidstone's    economy has changed over the years from being involved in heavy industry, to more light and    service industries.<br>
