      Airlink's Managed Services supports a "build-operate-transfer" model, enabling service providers to quickly and cost-effectively build out a large-scale, broadband wireless network by initially outsourcing operational functions to Pronto and eventually transferring operations in-house, if desired.

      As part of the service, Airlink provides all the back-office operations for customers from its Network Operations Center (NOC), leveraging its leading UniFi OSS platform.</p>
