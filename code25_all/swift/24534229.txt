var dict = Dictionary<String, Array<Int>>()
dict["key"] = [1, 2, 3]

// all of these fail
dict["key"] += 4
dict["key"].append(4) // xcode suggests dict["key"].?.append(4) which also fails
dict["key"]!.append(4)
dict["key"]?.append(4)

// however, I can do this:
var arr = dict["key"]!
arr.append(4) // this alone doesn't affect dict because it's a value type (and was copied)
dict["key"] = arr
