for var index = 0; index < MySupplierData.count; ++index {

  // Establish an Annotation
  myAnnotation = MKPointAnnotation();
  ... establish the coordinate,title, subtitle properties - this all works
  self.theMapView.addAnnotation(myAnnotation)  // this works great.

  // In thinking about PinView and how to set it up I have this...
  myPinView = MKPinAnnotationView();      
  myPinView.animatesDrop = true;
  myPinView.pinColor = MKPinAnnotationColor.Purple;  

  // Now how do I get this view to be used for this particular Annotation in theMapView that I am iterating through??? Somehow I need to marry them or know how to replace these attributes directly without the above code for each data point added to the view
  // It would be nice to have some kind of addPinView.
