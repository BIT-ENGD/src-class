//select RANDOM WORD from array

//determine the number of characters in the RANDOMLY SELECTED WORD

//randomly select a NUMBER within the boundries of the number of characters (i.e. if the word is "apple," select a number between 0 and 4)

//select the CHARACTER that corresponds to the randomly selected NUMBER

//add the CHARACTER to a new string (JUMBLE)

//remove the CHARCATER from the RANDOMLY SELECTED WORD

//Repeat until the RANDOM WORD is empty

//this is my array/word bank
var words = ["Apple", "Orange", "Pear"]

//this selects a random word in the array
var selectedWord = words[Int(arc4random_uniform(UInt32(words.count)))]

//this counts the number of characters in the string
var length = (countElements(selectedWord))

//this randomly selects a position within the string
var position = Int(arc4random_uniform(UInt32(length)))

//this creates a new string consiting of the letter found in the position from the previous line of code
var subString = selectedWord[advance(selectedWord.startIndex, position)]
