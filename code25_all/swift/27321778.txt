var row3text = "This is the value I need!"

var firstPart = "row"
var rowNumber = 3
var secondPart = "text"

var together = (firstPart+String(rowNumber)+secondPart)

// the below gives me the concatenated string of the three variables, but I'm looking for a way to have it return the value set at the top.
println (together)
