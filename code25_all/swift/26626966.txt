// Generic arrays in Swift are actually of type struct, not class but we need a class in this case since class objects are 
// passed by reference whereas structures are passed by value (copied).
// Our game logic will require a single copy of this data structure to persist across the entire game.
// Notice that in the class' declaration we provide a typed parameter: <T>. 
// This allows our array to store any type of data and therefore remain a general-purpose tool.

    //  an actual Swift array; it will be the underlying data structure which maintains references to our objects.
    // ? in Swift symbolizes an optional value. An optional value is just that, optional.
    // nil locations found on our game board will represent empty spots where no block is present.
    var array: Array<T?>

    init(colums: Int, rows: Int) {

        // we instantiate our internal array structure with a size of rows * columns. 
        // This guarantees that Array2D can store as many objects as our game board requires, 200 in our case.
