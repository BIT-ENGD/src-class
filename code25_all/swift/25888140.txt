    Probably at least one of the constraints in the following list is one you don't want. Try this: (1) look at each constraint and try to figure out which you don't expect; (2) find the code that added the unwanted constraint or constraints and fix it. (Note: If you're seeing NSAutoresizingMaskLayoutConstraints that you don't understand, refer to the documentation for the UIView property translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints)

    "<NSLayoutConstraint:0x178087e40 'UIView-Encapsulated-Layout-Height' V:[UIInputView:0x15e607830(264)]>",
    "<NSLayoutConstraint:0x1780882f0 V:[UIInputView:0x15e607830(180)]>"
)

Will attempt to recover by breaking constraint 
<NSLayoutConstraint:0x178087e40 'UIView-Encapsulated-Layout-Height' V:[UIInputView:0x15e607830(264)]>

Make a symbolic breakpoint at UIViewAlertForUnsatisfiableConstraints to catch this in the debugger.
The methods in the UIConstraintBasedLayoutDebugging category on UIView listed in <UIKit/UIView.h> may also be helpful.
