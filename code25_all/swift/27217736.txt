Probably at least one of the constraints in the following list is one you don't want. Try this:(1) look at each constraint and try to figure out which you don't expect; (2) find the code that added the unwanted constraint or constraints and fix it. (Note: If you're seeing NSAutoresizingMaskLayoutConstraints that you don't understand, refer to the documentation for the UIView property translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints) 
(
    "<NSLayoutConstraint:0x600000096940 V:[UIInputView:0x7fe780d3f600(246)]>",
    "<NSLayoutConstraint:0x600000097390 'UIView-Encapsulated-Layout-Height' V:[UIInputView:0x7fe780d3f600(0)]>"
)

Will attempt to recover by breaking constraint 
<NSLayoutConstraint:0x600000096940 V:[UIInputView:0x7fe780d3f600(246)]>

Make a symbolic breakpoint at UIViewAlertForUnsatisfiableConstraints to catch this in the debugger.
The methods in the UIConstraintBasedLayoutDebugging category on UIView listed in <UIKit/UIView.h> may also be helpful.

override func updateViewConstraints() {
    super.updateViewConstraints()
    // Add custom view sizing constraints here
    let changeToOrientation = deviceInfoService.getOrientationForView(self.inputView)

    if (changeToOrientation == Orientation.Portrait) {
        self._heightConstraint!.constant = 246
        self.inputView.addConstraint(self._heightConstraint!)
    } else {
        self._heightConstraint!.constant = 192
        self.inputView.addConstraint(self._heightConstraint!)
    }
}
