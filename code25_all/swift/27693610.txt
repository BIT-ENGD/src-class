Tried to save an object with a new, unsaved child.
let p = Product()
p.productName = "Test Product"
p.saveEventually()

let o = Order()
o.orderId = "TestOrder01"
o.product = p
o.saveEventually()

let query = Order.query()
query.whereKey("product", equalTo: p)

let results = query.findObjects() // crashes with Tried to save an object with a new, unsaved child.
