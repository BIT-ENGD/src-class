class firstClass {
    var name = “Name”

    init…..
}

class secondClass {
    var name = “Another name”

    init….

}


now another function can call

//does not work... I get an error saying AnyObject doesn't have property
func printNameOf(object: AnyObject) {
    println(object.name)
}

//works but my software has a lot of classes, which means a ton of code
func printNameOf(object: AnyObject) {
    if object is firstClass {
        println((object as firstClass).name)
    }

    if object is secondClass {
        println((object as secondClass).name)
    }
}
