let MyArray: Array<Int> = Array<Int>(count: 100, repeatedValue:(for i in 0...99))
// it does not work, I am doing it wrong :(
// instead of (for i in 0...99) could be anything, a key sequence generator

/// Construct a Array of `count` elements, each initialized to
/// `repeatedValue`.
init(count: Int, repeatedValue: T)
