"Grunts are a doe's way of saying come here , also to call her fawns at feeding time . It is critical to keep the call soft as a loud grunt is too aggressive of a call.",
"A buck grunt is a deeper pitch than a doe grunt , it means the same thing . The older the buck the deeper the tone. ",
"As the buck chases the doe as the rut approaches he is frustrated, and makes a series of soft grunts while trailing her. It's the bucks way of asking her to stop so he can be breed with her.",
"This sound's a lot like a calf bawl , but it is a series of buck bleats. This signals the bucks desire for company.",
"This is a non aggressive and social behaviour that all bucks do after shedding their velvet . This is when the bucks learn who can whip the other . This process does not prevent serious fights later on during the rut.",
"This is the sound that a buck makes during the courtship when the doe stops running , but won't let the buck breed her. It's a non aggressive and frustration call by him.",
"This is the sound that a Doe makes to signal that her breeding time is near.",
"This is the sound that a Doe makes to signal that she ready to breed RIGHT NOW.",
    "Deer make this sound to intimidate other deer and prevent fights. This call is often made by a rut- crazed buck when confronted with a rival. This sound can send smaller buck running from the area.",
"Another rut crazed Bucks sound to intimidate other deer and prevent fights when confronted with a rival. This sound can also send smaller buck running from the area.",
"This is a short aggressive rattling sequence to possibly lure in less aggressive, but curious buck, as well as the local dominant whitetail buck of the area. To make this sound like a real fight sniffs, wheezes and grunts have also been thrown in for added effect."]
