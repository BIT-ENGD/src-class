var value = 0.0 // I know this one declares value as a Double with the number 0.0
var value: Float = 0.0 // This one declares value as a Float with the number 0.0
var value: Float? // I really don't get the difference between this
var value: Float! // and this, I just know that both of them are used to declare a variable without a value, am I right ?
