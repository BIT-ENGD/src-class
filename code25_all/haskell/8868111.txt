natlog x = until cond count (1,1,0)
    where 
        cond (_,val,_) = val < 0.001
        count (i,val,sum) = (i+1,(-x)^i/i,sum+val)

<interactive>:1:8:
    Ambiguous type variable `t0' in the constraints:
      (Num t0) arising from the literal `1' at <interactive>:1:8
      (Integral t0) arising from a use of `natlog' at <interactive>:1:1-6
      (Fractional t0) arising from a use of `natlog'
                      at <interactive>:1:1-6
    Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    In the first argument of `natlog', namely `1'
    In the expression: natlog 1
    In an equation for `it': it = natlog 1
