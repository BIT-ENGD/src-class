buildlist :: Int -> Int -> [Int]
buildlist n m = do
    seed <- getStdGen
    let l = randomRs (0, m) seed
    let list = take n l
    return list

    Couldn't match expected type `[t0]' with actual type `IO StdGen'
In a stmt of a 'do' block: seed <- getStdGen
In the expression:
  do { seed <- getStdGen;
       let l = randomRs ... seed;
       let list = take n l;
       return list }
In an equation for `buildlist':
    buildlist n m
      = do { seed <- getStdGen;
             let l = ...;
             let list = ...;
             .... }
