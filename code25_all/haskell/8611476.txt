isPerfectSquare :: (RealFloat t) => t -> Bool
isPerfectSquare n = 
    (sqrt n) == (truncate (sqrt n))

Could not deduce (Integral t) arising from a use of `truncate'
from the context (RealFloat t)
  bound by the type signature for
             isPerfectSquare :: RealFloat t => t -> Bool
  at more.hs:(73,1)-(74,35)
Possible fix:
  add (Integral t) to the context of
    the type signature for isPerfectSquare :: RealFloat t => t -> Bool
In the second argument of `(==)', namely `(truncate (sqrt n))'
In the expression: (sqrt n) == (truncate (sqrt n))
In an equation for `isPerfectSquare':
    isPerfectSquare n = (sqrt n) == (truncate (sqrt n))
