cabal: Missing dependency on a foreign library:
* Missing C library: cryptopp
This problem can usually be solved by installing the system package that
provides this library (you may need the "-dev" version). If the library is
already installed but in a non-standard location then you can use the flags
--extra-include-dirs= and --extra-lib-dirs= to specify where it is.
cabal: Error: some packages failed to install:
happstack-server-6.5.3 failed during the configure step. The exception was:
ExitFailure 1

sudo port install libcryptopp

cabal install happstack-server --extra-lib-dirs=/opt/local/lib

~$ runhaskell Hello.hs
Hello.hs: <command line>: can't load .so/.DLL for: libcryptopp.dylib (dlopen(libcryptopp.dylib, 9): image not found)
