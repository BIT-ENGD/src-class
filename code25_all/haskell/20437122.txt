* happy            (program)
    Synopsis:      Happy is a parser generator for Haskell
    Versions available: 1.16, 1.17, 1.18.8, 1.18.9, 1.18.10, 1.18.11, 1.19.0,
                        1.19.1, 1.19.2 (and 7 others)
    Versions installed: [ Unknown ]
    Homepage:      http://www.haskell.org/happy/
    Bug reports:   https://github.com/simonmar/happy/issues
    Description:   Happy is a parser generator for Haskell. Given a grammar
                   specification in BNF, Happy generates Haskell code to parse
                   the grammar. Happy works in a similar way to the @yacc@ tool
                   for C.
