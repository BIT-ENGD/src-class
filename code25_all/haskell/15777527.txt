Prelude Language.Haskell.TH> runQ [d| data X = X deriving Show |]

<interactive>:4:30:
    The exact Name `X' is not in scope
      Probable cause: you used a unique name (NameU) in Template Haskell but did not bind it
    In the Template Haskell quotation [d| data X = X deriving (Show) |]
    In the first argument of `runQ', namely
      `[d| data X = X deriving (Show) |]'
    In the expression: runQ [d| data X = X deriving (Show) |]
