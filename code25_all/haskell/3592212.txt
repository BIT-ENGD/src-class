Using the binary tree type that we defined earlier in this chapter, 
write a function that will determine the height of the tree. The height 
is the largest number of hops from the root to an Empty. For example, the 
tree Empty has height zero; Node "x" Empty Empty has height one; 
Node "x" Empty (Node "y" Empty Empty) has height two; and so on.

36 data Tree a = Node a (Tree a) (Tree a)
37             | Empty
38               deriving (Show)
39
40 --problem 9:Determine the height of a tree
41 height :: Tree -> Int
42 height (Tree node left right) = if (left == Empty && right == Empty) then 0 else max (height left) (height right)
