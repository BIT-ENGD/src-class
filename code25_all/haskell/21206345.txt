isPermutation :: (Ord a) => [a] -> [a] -> Bool
isPermutation x y = sort x == sort y

isPermutation "123" "312" -> True
isPermutation "123" "111" -> False

groupBy isPermutation ["123","3","321"] -> ["123","3","321"] <- What I get

groupBy isPermutation ["123","3","321"] -> [["123","321"],"3"] <- What I would want
