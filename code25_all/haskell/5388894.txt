GHCi runtime linker: fatal error: I found a duplicate definition for symbol
   ghczm7zi0zi2_AsmCodeGen_zdfMonadCmmOptM2_closure
whilst processing object file
   /usr/local/lib/ghc-7.0.2/ghc-7.0.2/libHSghc-7.0.2.a
This could be caused by:
   * Loading two different object files which export the same symbol
   * Specifying the same object file twice on the GHCi command line
   * An incorrect `package.conf' entry, causing some object to be
     loaded twice.
GHCi cannot safely continue in this situation.  Exiting now.  Sorry.
