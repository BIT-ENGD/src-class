Inferred type is less polymorphic than expected
  Quantified type variable `tag' is mentioned in the environment:
    diff_error :: [FAD.Dual tag Double] -> FAD.Dual tag Double
      (bound at Operations.hs:100:33)
In the first argument of `FAD.grad', namely
    `(diff_error :: [FAD.Dual tag a] -> FAD.Dual tag b)'
In the expression:
    FAD.grad (diff_error :: [FAD.Dual tag a] -> FAD.Dual tag b) weights
In the definition of `diffs':
    diffs = FAD.grad
              (diff_error :: [FAD.Dual tag a] -> FAD.Dual tag b) weights
