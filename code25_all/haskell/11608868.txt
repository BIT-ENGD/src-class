ReaderT
ReaderT Env IO String

...is a computation which involves reading values from some environment 
of type Env (the semantics of Reader, the base monad) and performing some 
IO in order to give a value of type String.

1. ( Already has ) some environment values          -- ReaderT Env
2. Do `IO` accroding to these pre-existing values   -- IO a
3. Use the `IO a` values to do more computations    -- IO b...z

1. Do some `IO` to load environment settings        -- IO a first !!
2. Do more `IO` according to these settings         -- fill the env and do IO
