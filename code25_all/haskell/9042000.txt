> writeAllLabels = do

Running my Query (not shown, accesses the RDF TrippleStore):
>             res <- (selectStr33 (unlines qAllLabels))

>             outh <- openFile "/tmp/haskell_output.txt" WriteMode

this is the important line. If I would write "utf8" her instead of "latin1", I would get the wrong result again, i.e. as before asking the question...
>             hSetEncoding outh latin1

>             hPutStrLn outh res
>             hClose outh
