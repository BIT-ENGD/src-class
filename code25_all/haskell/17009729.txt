Couldn't match type `a' with `(a, b0)'
  `a' is a rigid type variable bound by
      the type signature for sumPointwise :: Num a => [(a, a)] -> (a, a)
      at .hs:42:1
In the first argument of `fst', namely `y'
In the second argument of `(+)', namely `(fst y)'
In the expression: (fst x) + (fst y)
