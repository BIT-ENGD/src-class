Configuring HsOpenSSL-0.10.3.5...
cabal.exe: Missing dependencies on foreign libraries:
* Missing C libraries: eay32, ssl32
This problem can usually be solved by installing the system packages that
provide these libraries (you may need the "-dev" versions). If the libraries
are already installed but in a non-standard location then you can use the
flags --extra-include-dirs= and --extra-lib-dirs= to specify where they are.
