replicate
replicate' :: Enum a => a -> b -> [b]
replicate' a b = [b | _ <- [1..a]]

proginhaskell.hs:152:29:
Could not deduce (Num a) arising from the literal `1'
from the context (Enum a)
  bound by the type signature for
             replicate' :: Enum a => a -> b -> [b]
  at proginhaskell.hs:152:1-34
Possible fix:
  add (Num a) to the context of
    the type signature for replicate' :: Enum a => a -> b -> [b]
In the expression: 1
In the expression: [1 .. a]
In a stmt of a list comprehension: _ <- [1 .. a]
