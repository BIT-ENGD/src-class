type String = [Char]

stringDecode :: String -> Maybe String
stringDecode s =
  let
    splitByColon x' = splitAt x' s
  in case findIndex (\b -> b == ':') s of
     (Just x)  -> snd (splitByColon x) 
     (Nothing) -> Nothing

Couldn't match expected type `Maybe String'
            with actual type `[Char]'
Expected type: ([Char], Maybe String)
  Actual type: ([Char], [Char])
In the return type of a call of `splitByColon'
In the first argument of `snd', namely `(splitByColon x)'

Maybe String
[Char]
Just [Char]
