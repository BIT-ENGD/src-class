Setup: Missing dependency on a foreign library:
* Missing C library: gmp
This problem can usually be solved by installing the system package that
provides this library (you may need the "-dev" version). If the library is
already installed but in a non-standard location then you can use the flags
--extra-include-dirs= and --extra-lib-dirs= to specify where it is.

integer-gmp-0.4.0.0
C:\Program Files\Haskell Platform\2012.4.0.0\lib
