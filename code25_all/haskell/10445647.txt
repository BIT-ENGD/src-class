-- We used to use System.Posix.Internals.dEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE, which is
-- taken from the value of BUFSIZ on the current platform.  This value
-- varies too much though: it is 512 on Windows, 1024 on OS X and 8192
-- on Linux.  So let's just use a decent size on every platform:
dEFAULT_FD_BUFFER_SIZE :: Int
dEFAULT_FD_BUFFER_SIZE = 8096
