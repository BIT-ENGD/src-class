data D t where
    C :: t -> D t
    R :: D b -> D (Either a b)
deriving instance Show t => Show (D t)

Could not deduce (Show b) from the context (t ~ Either a b)
  arising from a use of `showsPrec' at tmp.hs:37:0-37
Possible fix: add (Show b) to the context of the constructor `R'
In the second argument of `(.)', namely `(showsPrec 11 b1)'
In the second argument of `showParen', namely
    `((.) (showString "R ") (showsPrec 11 b1))'
In the expression:
    showParen ((a >= 11)) ((.) (showString "R ") (showsPrec 11 b1))
When typechecking a standalone-derived method for `Show (D t)':
  showsPrec a (C b1)
              = showParen ((a >= 11)) ((.) (showString "C ") (showsPrec 11 b1))
  showsPrec a (R b1)
              = showParen ((a >= 11)) ((.) (showString "R ") (showsPrec 11 b1))
