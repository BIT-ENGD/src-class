    Warning: newtype `CInt' is used in an FFI declaration,
             but its constructor is not in scope.
             This will become an error in GHC 7.6.1.
    When checking declaration:
      foreign import ccall safe "static bitfield_direction" bitfield_direction
        :: CInt

import Foreign.C.Types(CInt)
