cabal
This version of the package has already been uploaded.

As a matter of policy we do not allow package tarballs to be changed after a
release (so we can guarantee stable md5sums etc). The usual recommendation is
to upload a new version, and if necessary blacklist the existing one. In
extraordinary circumstances, contact the administrators.
