GHCi runtime linker: fatal error: I found a duplicate definition for symbol
  aizmvszmaizmlibzm0zi1_FooziBar_zdfTypeableBazzuds2_closure
whilst processing object file
  /home/joey/.cabal/lib/foo-0.1/ghc-7.6.3/HSfoo-0.1.o
This could be caused by:
  * Loading two different object files which export the same symbol
  * Specifying the same object file twice on the GHCi command line
  * An incorrect `package.conf' entry, causing some object to be
    loaded twice.
GHCi cannot safely continue in this situation.  Exiting now.  Sorry.
