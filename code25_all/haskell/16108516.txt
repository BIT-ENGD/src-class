bounds1Accum ::  [Integer] -> Integer -> Integer -> (Integer, Integer)
bounds1Accum l min max = (minimum (min:l), maximum (max:l))

bounds1 :: [l] -> Maybe(min,max)
bounds1 [] = Nothing (which I am unsure if this will be correct)

bounds1 l  min max  = if null l then Nothing else Just $ bounds1 bounds1Accum min max
