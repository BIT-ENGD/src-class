    Couldn't match expected type `MaybeT m0 t0'
                with actual type `Maybe a0'
    In the return type of a call of `M.lookup'
    In a stmt of a 'do' expression: m <- M.lookup "a" a
    In the second argument of `($)', namely
      `do { m <- M.lookup "a" a;
              lift $ putStrLn m }'

import qualified Data.Map as M

main = do
    let a = M.fromList [("a", "b"), ("c", "d")]
    runMaybeT $ do
        m <- M.lookup "a" a
