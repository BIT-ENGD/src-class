    ByteCodeLink: can't find label
    During interactive linking, GHCi couldn't find the following symbol:
              richards
    This may be due to you not asking GHCi to load extra object files,
    archives or DLLs needed by your current session.  Restart GHCi, specifying
    the missing library using the -L/path/to/object/dir and -lmissinglibname
    flags, or simply by naming the relevant files on the GHCi command line.
    Alternatively, this link failure might indicate a bug in GHCi.
    If you suspect the latter, please send a bug report to:
