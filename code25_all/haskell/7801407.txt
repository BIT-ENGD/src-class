test.hs:5:9:
    Ambiguous type variable `a0' in the constraints:
      (Show a0) arising from a use of `print' at test.hs:5:9-13
      (Read a0) arising from a use of `readLn' at test.hs:4:14-19
    Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    In a stmt of a 'do' expression: print z
    In the expression:
      do { z <- readLn;
           print z;
           return () }
    In an equation for `main':
        main
          = do { z <- readLn;
                 print z;
                 return () }
