permute [] = [[]]
permute xs = [y| x <- xs, y <- map (x:) $ permute $ delete x xs]

permute [] = [[]]
permute xs = map (\x -> map (x:) $ permute $ delete x xs) xs

Occurs check: cannot construct the infinite type: t0 = [t0]
Expected type: [t0]
Actual type: [[t0]]
In the expression: map (x :) $ permute $ delete x xs
In the first argument of `map', namely
`(\ x -> map (x :) $ permute $ delete x xs)'
