pad.hs:1:19:
    No instance for (Num Bool) arising from the literal `4'
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Num Bool)
    In the expression: 4
    In the expression: [4 .. ]
    In a stmt of a list comprehension: c <- [4 .. ]

pad.hs:1:30:
    No instance for (Integral Bool) arising from a use of `divisible'
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Integral Bool)
    In the first argument of `any', namely `(divisible c)'
    In the expression: any (divisible c) (factors c)
    In a stmt of a list comprehension: any (divisible c) (factors c)

pad.hs:3:43:
    No instance for (Floating Bool) arising from a use of `sqrt'
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Floating Bool)
    In the second argument of `(<)', namely `sqrt c'
    In the first argument of `takeWhile', namely `(< sqrt c)'
    In the expression: takeWhile (< sqrt c) primes
