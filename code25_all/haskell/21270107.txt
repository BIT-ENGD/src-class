bar :: (Rel a b) => a -> b

Could not deduce (Rel a b1) arising from a use of `aToB'
from the context (Rel a b)
  bound by the type signature for bar :: Rel a b => a -> b
  at q.hs:79:1-23
Possible fix:
  add (Rel a b1) to the context of
    an expression type signature: b1
    or the type signature for bar :: Rel a b => a -> b
In the expression: aToB val :: b
In an equation for `bar': bar val = aToB val :: b
