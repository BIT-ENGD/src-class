Configuring HDBC-sqlite3-2.3.0.0...
setup: Missing dependency on a foreign library:
* Missing C library: sqlite3
This problem can usually be solved by installing the system package that
provides this library (you may need the "-dev" version). If the library is
already installed but in a non-standard location then you can use the flags
--extra-include-dirs= and --extra-lib-dirs= to specify where it is.
