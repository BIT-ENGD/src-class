Couldn't match expected type `Int' with actual type `[Int]

[100,50]
Hand
module Main where

coins = [100,50,20,10,5,2,1]

euler31 :: Int
euler31 = 1 + length (twoPoundCombinations)

twoPoundCombinations = recursion [] [[]]

recursion :: [Int] -> [[Int]] -> [[Int]],
recursion hand result
    | sum hand == 200 = [hand]
    | sum hand  > 200 = [[]]
    | sum hand  < 200 = result ++ map (\x -> recursion (x:hand) [[]]) coins
