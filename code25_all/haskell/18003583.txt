src/Vim/Netbeans.hs:88:40:
Could not deduce (MonadReader ConnState m)
  arising from a use of `local'
from the context (Monad m)
  bound by the instance declaration at src/Vim/Netbeans.hs:86:10-54
Possible fix:
  add (MonadReader ConnState m) to the context of
    the type signature for
      local :: (ConnState -> ConnState) -> Netbeans m a -> Netbeans m a
    or the instance declaration
  or add an instance declaration for (MonadReader ConnState m)
In the first argument of `mapReaderT', namely `(local f)'
In the second argument of `($)', namely
  `mapReaderT (local f) (unNetbeans x)'
In the expression: Netbeans $ mapReaderT (local f) (unNetbeans x)
