    Could not deduce (Ord a) from the context ()
      arising from a use of `always'
                   at ...probabilisticModeling.hs:42:13-18
    Possible fix:
      add (Ord a) to the context of the type signature for `return'
    In the expression: always
    In the definition of `return': return = always
    In the instance declaration for `Monad Distribution'

    return :: (Ord a) => a -> Distribution a = always
