"<"interactive">":1:8:
    The lambda expression `\ x y -> x + 1 == y' has two arguments, 
    but its type `a -> Bool' has only one 
    In the first argument of `filter', namely `(\ x y -> x + 1 == y)' 
    In the expression: filter (\ x y -> x + 1 == y) xs 
    In the definition of `it': it = filter (\ x y -> x + 1 == y) xs
