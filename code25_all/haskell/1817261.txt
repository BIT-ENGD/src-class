pCheck :: (Eq a) => [a] -> Bool;
pCheck a = take n a == ( take n $ reverse a )
  where n = floor ( length a / 2 )

No instance for (RealFrac Int)
  arising from a use of `floor' at len.hs:13:11-32
Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (RealFrac Int)
In the expression: floor (length a / 2)
In the definition of `n': n = floor (length a / 2)
In the definition of `pCheck':
    pCheck a = take n a == (take n $ reverse a)
             where
                 n = floor (length a / 2)

a == reverse a
