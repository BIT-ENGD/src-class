fc :: (Bool, [Char]) -> Int -> Integer -> [Bool]

fc :: (Bool, [Char]) -> Int
fc (x, y) = ord (head y)

Int
Integer
toInteger
Couldn't match expected type `Int -> Integer'
            with actual type `Integer'
In the return type of a call of `toInteger'
Probable cause: `toInteger' is applied to too many arguments
In the expression: toInteger (ord (head y))

fc :: (Bool, [Char]) -> Int -> Integer
fc (x, y) = toInteger (ord (head y))
