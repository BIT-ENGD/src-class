inputGame :: Input -> Game -> Game
inputGame i g = flip execState g $ do
    let es = g ^. userInput . events
        sg = g ^. scene
    userInput .= i
    scene .= foldl (flip inputEvent) sg es

inputEvent :: InputEvent -> SceneGraph -> SceneGraph
inputEvent (WindowSizeChangedTo (w,h)) (SceneRoot _ _ sg) = SceneRoot w h sg
inputEvent _ sg = sg

No instance for (Monoid SceneGraph) arising from a use of `scene'
Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Monoid SceneGraph)
In the second argument of `(^.)', namely `scene'
In the expression: g ^. scene
In an equation for `sg': sg = g ^. scene
