cabal: cannot configure tls-extra-0.4.1. It requires certificate >=1.0.0 &&
<1.1.0 and cryptocipher >=0.3.0
For the dependency on certificate >=1.0.0 && <1.1.0 there are these packages:
certificate-1.0.0. However none of them are available.
certificate-1.0.0 was excluded because http-enumerator-0.7.1.3 requires
certificate >=0.7 && <0.10
For the dependency on cryptocipher >=0.3.0 there are these packages:
cryptocipher-0.3.0. However none of them are available.
cryptocipher-0.3.0 was excluded because clientsession-0.7.3.2 requires
cryptocipher >=0.2.5 && <0.3
