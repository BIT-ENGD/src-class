{-|
Describes a Clients connection and provides an interface for
storing data associated with the client. Each client will be given
a unique cid and are Eq if their cid's are Eq.

A ClientConn comes packaged with two functions for storing additional
information in Strings, lookup and modify. The lookup function
takes a key and returns the current value of the key or the empty
string if it has never been set. The modify function
takes a key and value and updates it such that the next call to
lookup with that key will return the value provided.
