cabal: cannot configure blaze-builder-0.2.0.2. It requires text ==0.10.*
For the dependency on text ==0.10.* there are these packages: text-0.10.0.0,
text-0.10.0.1 and text-0.10.0.2. However none of them are available.
text-0.10.0.0 was excluded because enumerator-0.4.3.1 requires text ==0.11.*
text-0.10.0.1 was excluded because enumerator-0.4.3.1 requires text ==0.11.*
text-0.10.0.2 was excluded because enumerator-0.4.3.1 requires text ==0.11.*
