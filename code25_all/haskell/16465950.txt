    Couldn't match expected type `(IO a, t0)' with actual type `IO a'
    In a stmt of a 'do' block: s <- x
    In the expression:
      do { s <- x;
           if f s then (return x, xs) else nextMatch f xs }
    In an equation for `nextMatch':
        nextMatch f (x : xs)
          = do { s <- x;
                 if f s then (return x, xs) else nextMatch f xs }
