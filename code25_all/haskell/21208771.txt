Couldn't match type `()' with `[Char]'
Expected type: IOError -> IO String
  Actual type: IOError -> IO ()
In the second argument of `catch', namely `readHandler'
In a stmt of a 'do' block:
  contents <- (readFile "path") `catch` readHandler
In the expression:
  do { contents <- (readFile "path") `catch` readHandler;
       putStrLn contents }

readHandler :: IOError -> IO ()
readHandler :: IOError -> IO String
