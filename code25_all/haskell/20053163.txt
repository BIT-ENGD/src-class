moveOn
No instance for (At AtText b0) arising from a use of `moveOn'
  The type variable `b0' is ambiguous
Possible fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
  Note: there is a potential instance available:
    instance At AtText Char

b0
moveOn
test :: AtText -> whatever
test at = 
    let nextAtOpt = moveOn at in -- <--- a probem
    case nextAtOpt of
        Just nextAt -> undefined
        Nothing -> undefined
