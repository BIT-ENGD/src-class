a.hs:5:15:
    Could not deduce (Enum a)
     arising from the arithmetic sequence `(x - n + 1) .. x'
    from the context (Num a)
      bound by the type signature for ff :: Num a => a -> a -> a
      at a.hs:5:1-32
    Possible fix:
      add (Enum a) to the context of
        the type signature for ff :: Num a => a -> a -> a
    In the first argument of `prod', namely `[(x - n + 1) .. x]'
    In the expression: prod [(x - n + 1) .. x]
    In an equation for `ff': ff x n = prod [(x - n + 1) .. x]
