let merge x y = (min (head x) (head y)) : 
     case (min (head x) (head y)) of 
         head x -> merge (drop 1 x) y 
         head y -> merge x (drop 1 y)

- output the min of the heads of the lists
- if the first lists head was output call merge 
  with the rest of the first list and the second
- else call merge with the first list and the rest
  of the second list
