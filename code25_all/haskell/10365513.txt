class Problem p where
    readProblem :: String -> p
    solveProblem :: p -> String

readAndSolve = solveProblem . readProblem

Ambiguous type variable `b0' in the constraint:
  (Problem b0) arising from a use of `readProblem'
Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
In the second argument of `(.)', namely `readProblem'
In the expression: solveProblem . readProblem
In an equation for `readAndSolve':
    readAndSolve = solveProblem . readProblem
