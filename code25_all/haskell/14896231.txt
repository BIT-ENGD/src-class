writers :: [(String, Writer)]
Association list of formats and writers. 

zurgl>>>import Text.Pandoc as P
zurgl>>>P.writers 

<interactive>:20:1:
    No instance for (Show (WriterOptions -> Pandoc -> [Char]))
      arising from a use of `print'
    Possible fix:
      add an instance declaration for
      (Show (WriterOptions -> Pandoc -> [Char]))
    In a stmt of an interactive GHCi command: print it
