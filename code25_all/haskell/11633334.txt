Ambiguous type variable `k0' in the constraint:
      (Show k0) arising from a use of `print'
    Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    In a stmt of a 'do' block: print M.empty
    In the expression: do { print M.empty }
    In an equation for `test': test = do { print M.empty }
