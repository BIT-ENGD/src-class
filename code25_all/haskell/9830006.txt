data Maybe' a = Nothing' | Just' a deriving (Show)

class From' t

instance From' Maybe' 
    where from' (Just' x) = x

from2 :: t a -> a 
from2 (Just' x)  = x

Couldn't match type `t' with `Maybe''
  `t' is a rigid type variable bound by
      the type signature for from2 :: t a -> a at test.hs:11:1
In the pattern: Just' x
In an equation for `from2': from2 (Just' x) = x
