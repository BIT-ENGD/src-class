printLength1::(Num a)=>String->a
printLength1 s = length s


printLength2::String->Int
printLength2 s = length s

Couldn't match type `a' with `Int'
      `a' is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for rpnc :: String -> a at test.hs:20:1
    In the return type of a call of `length'
    In the expression: length s
    In an equation for `rpnc': rpnc s = length s
