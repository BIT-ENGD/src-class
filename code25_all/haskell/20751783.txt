Could not deduce (b ~ Dynamic)
from the context (Typeable b)
  bound by the type signature for getA :: Typeable b => b -> IO ()

getA :: Dynamic -> IO ()
No instance for (Typeable a0) arising from a use of `fromDynamic'
The type variable `a0' is ambiguous
Possible fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)

x
case fromDynamic t of
  Nothing -> error "Nao Foi Possível Converter"
  Just x -> putStrLn$ sayHello x

sayHello
x
