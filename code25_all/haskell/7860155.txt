cabal: cannot configure cprng-aes-0.2.2. It requires crypto-api >=0.8
For the dependency on crypto-api >=0.8 there are these packages:
crypto-api-0.8. However none of them are available.
crypto-api-0.8 was excluded because skein-0.1.0.1 requires crypto-api ==0.6.*
crypto-api-0.8 was excluded because crypto-api-0.6.4 was selected instead
crypto-api-0.8 was excluded because clientsession-0.7.3.1 requires crypto-api
>=0.6.4 && <0.7
