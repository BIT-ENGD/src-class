    setup.exe: Missing dependencies on foreign libraries:
    * Missing C libraries: gobject-2.0, gthread-2.0, glib-2.0, intl, iconv
    This problem can usually be solved by installing the system packages that
    provide these libraries (you may need the "-dev" versions). If the libraries
    are already installed but in a non-standard location then you can use the
    flags --extra-include-dirs= and --extra-lib-dirs= to specify where they are.
    cabal: Error: some packages failed to install:
    glib-0.12.0 failed during the configure step. The exception was:
    ExitFailure 1
