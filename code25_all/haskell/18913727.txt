Couldn't match expected type `ProgramSearchPath
                              -> IO (Maybe FilePath)'
            with actual type `IO (Maybe FilePath)'
In the return type of a call of `findJustBy'
Probable cause: `findJustBy' is applied to too many arguments
In the expression:
  findJustBy (findProgramLocation v) llvmConfigNames
In the expression:
  \ v -> findJustBy (findProgramLocation v) llvmConfigNames
