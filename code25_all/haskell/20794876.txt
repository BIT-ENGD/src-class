 GHCi runtime linker: fatal error: I found a duplicate definition for symbol
  __stginit_hsloggerzm1zi2zi3_SystemziLog
whilst processing object file
  /home/joey/stuff/workspace/myproject/.cabal-sandbox/lib/x86_64-linux-ghc-7.6.3/hslogger-1.2.3/libHShslogger-1.2.3.a
This could be caused by:
  * Loading two different object files which export the same symbol
  * Specifying the same object file twice on the GHCi command line
  * An incorrect `package.conf' entry, causing some object to be
    loaded twice.
GHCi cannot safely continue in this situation.  Exiting now.  Sorry.

Exit code: ExitFailure 1
