GHCi runtime linker: fatal error: I found a duplicate definition for symbol
   fps_minimum
whilst processing object file
   /usr/local/lib/bytestring-0.10.0.1/ghc-7.4.1/HSbytestring-0.10.0.1.o
This could be caused by:
   * Loading two different object files which export the same symbol
   * Specifying the same object file twice on the GHCi command line
   * An incorrect `package.conf' entry, causing some object to be
     loaded twice.
GHCi cannot safely continue in this situation.  Exiting now.  Sorry.
