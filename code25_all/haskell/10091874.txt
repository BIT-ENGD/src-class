maxFactor 1
<interactive>:0:1:
    No instance for (Integral ([a0] -> a0))
      arising from a use of `maxFactor'
    Possible fix:
      add an instance declaration for (Integral ([a0] -> a0))
    In the expression: maxFactor 1
    In an equation for `it': it = maxFactor 1

<interactive>:0:11:
    No instance for (Num ([a0] -> a0))
      arising from the literal `1'
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Num ([a0] -> a0))
    In the first argument of `maxFactor', namely `1'
    In the expression: maxFactor 1
    In an equation for `it': it = maxFactor 1
