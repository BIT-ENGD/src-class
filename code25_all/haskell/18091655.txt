class InnerProductSpace a b c where
dot :: a -> b -> c

data Vector = Vector [Double]
  deriving (Show)

instance InnerProductSpace Vector Vector Double where
  dot (Vector a) (Vector b) = (head a * head b)

No instance for (InnerProductSpace Vector Vector c0)
  arising from a use of `dot'
The type variable `c0' is ambiguous
Possible fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
Note: there is a potential instance available:
  instance InnerProductSpace Vector Vector Double
    -- Defined at Vector.hs:8:10
Possible fix:
  add an instance declaration for
  (InnerProductSpace Vector Vector c0)
In the expression: dot a b
In an equation for `it': it = dot a b
