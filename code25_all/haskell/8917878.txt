ghci> let avg xs = (sum xs) / (length xs)

No instance for (Fractional Int)
  arising from a use of `/'
Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Fractional Int)
In the expression: (sum xs) / (length xs)
In an equation for `avg': avg xs = (sum xs) / (length xs)

ghci> let a = (sum [1,2])
ghci> let b = (length [1,2])

ghci> a/b

Couldn't match expected type `Integer' with actual type `Int'
In the second argument of `(/)', namely `b'
In the expression: a / b
In an equation for `it': it = a / b

Integer
Int
