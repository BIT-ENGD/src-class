Loading package time-1.2.0.5 ...

GHCi runtime linker: fatal error: I found a duplicate definition for symbol
   _get_current_timezone_seconds
whilst processing object file
   C:\Users\guthrie\AppData\Roaming\cabal\time-1.2.0.5\ghc-7.4.1\HStime-1.2.0.5.o
This could be caused by:
   * Loading two different object files which export the same symbol
   * Specifying the same object file twice on the GHCi command line
   * An incorrect `package.conf' entry, causing some object to be
     loaded twice.
GHCi cannot safely continue in this situation.  Exiting now.  Sorry.
