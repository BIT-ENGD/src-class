'func.hs:38:58:
    No instance for (Num t0) arising from the literal `1'
    The type variable `t0' is ambiguous
    Possible fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    Note: there are several potential instances:
      instance Num Double -- Defined in `GHC.Float'
      instance Num Float -- Defined in `GHC.Float'
      instance Integral a => Num (GHC.Real.Ratio a)
        -- Defined in `GHC.Real'
      ...plus three others
    In the expression: 1
    In the third argument of `printf', namely `[1, 2, 3, 4, ....]'
    In a stmt of a 'do' block:
      printf "the length of this list is %d" length' [1, 2, 3, 4, ....]"
