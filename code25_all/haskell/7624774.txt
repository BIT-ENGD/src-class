Couldn't match expected type `Tree a'
       against inferred type `Tree t -> Tree t'
Probable cause: `maptree' is applied to too few arguments
In the first argument of `Node', namely `(maptree xl)'
In the expression: Node (maptree xl) (maptree xr)

maptree (Leaf a)= Leaf ( a + 1)
maptree (Node xl xr ) = Node (maptree xl) (maptree xr)
