Prelude> :t (==[])
(==[]) :: (Eq [a]) => [a] -> Bool

Eq [a]
Eq a
Prelude> (==[]) ([]::[IO ()])

<interactive>:1:1:
No instance for (Eq (IO ()))
  arising from use of `==' at <interactive>:1:1-2
Probable fix: add an instance declaration for (Eq (IO ()))
In the definition of `it': it = (== []) ([] :: [IO ()])
