t m

Couldn't match expected type `(Int -> Bool) -> [Int] -> t'
       against inferred type `[[a]]'
In the expression: all (== n) (map length all)
In the expression:
    let (m, n) = (length all, length x) in all (== n) (map length all)
In the definition of `t':
    t (all@(x : xs))
           = let (m, n) = ... in all (== n) (map length all)
