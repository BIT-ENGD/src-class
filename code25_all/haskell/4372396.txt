func :: Int -> Int -> Int 
func n x = floor (log . fromIntegral n / (log . fromIntegral x))

No instance for (RealFrac (a -> b))
  arising from a use of `floor' at p5_evenly_divide.hs:20:11-63
Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (RealFrac (a -> b))
In the expression:
    floor (log . fromIntegral n / (log . fromIntegral x))
In the definition of `func':
    func n x = floor (log . fromIntegral n / (log . fromIntegral x))
