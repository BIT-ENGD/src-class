[23 of 23] Compiling Main             ( src/Main.hs, dist/build/scion-browser/scion-browser-tmp/Main.o )

src/Main.hs:31:24:
    No instance for (MonadException BrowserM)
      arising from a use of `getInputLine'
    Possible fix:
      add an instance declaration for (MonadException BrowserM)
    In a stmt of a 'do' block: maybeLine <- getInputLine ""
    In the expression:
      do { maybeLine <- getInputLine "";
           case maybeLine of {
             Nothing -> return ()
             Just line -> do { ... } } }
    In an equation for `loop':
        loop
          = do { maybeLine <- getInputLine "";
                 case maybeLine of {
                   Nothing -> return ()
                   Just line -> ... } }
