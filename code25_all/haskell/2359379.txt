map distance (-3,-3) buildings

let distance pointA pointB = sqrt ( (frst pointB - frst pointA) * (frst pointB - frst pointA) + (scnd pointB - scnd pointA) * (scnd pointB - scnd pointA) )

buildings = [(3,-2),(2,1),(5,3),(4,3),(4,-1)]

firstDiff pointA pointB = subtract ( fst pointA ) ( fst pointB )

secondDiff pointA pointB = subtract ( snd pointA ) ( snd pointB )

distance pointA pointB = sqrt ( (firstDiff pointA pointB) * (firstDiff pointA pointB) +     (secondDiff pointA pointB) * (secondDiff pointA pointB))

--- What I need to happen here is a list "score" to be created by taking all distances from a point in a list lPoints to a point in list buildings.
