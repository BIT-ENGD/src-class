maxdiag (as:bs:cs:ds)
maxdiag ((a:as):(b:bs):(c:cs):(d:ds):xs) len =
  maximum [a*(bs !! 0)*(cs !! 1)*(ds !! 2), maxdiag (as:bs:cs:ds) (len-1)]

Occurs check: cannot construct the infinite type: a0 = [a0]
Expected type: [[a0]]
  Actual type: [a0]
In the second argument of `(:)', namely `ds'
In the second argument of `(:)', namely `cs : ds'
