No instance for (Eq a0) arising from a use of `nub'
The type variable `a0' is ambiguous
Possible cause: the monomorphism restriction applied to the following:
  merge :: [(a0, a0)] -> [a0] (bound at P.hs:9:1)
Probable fix: give these definition(s) an explicit type signature
              or use -XNoMonomorphismRestriction
Note: there are several potential instances:
  instance Eq a => Eq (GHC.Real.Ratio a) -- Defined in `GHC.Real'
  instance Eq () -- Defined in `GHC.Classes'
  instance (Eq a, Eq b) => Eq (a, b) -- Defined in `GHC.Classes'
  ...plus 22 others
In the first argument of `(.)', namely `nub'
In the expression: nub . mergeTuples
In an equation for `merge':
    merge
      = nub . mergeTuples
      where
          mergeTuples = foldr (\ (a, b) r -> a : b : r) []
