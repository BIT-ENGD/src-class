IO (Maybe a)
Serialize
 msg <- fun token
 print msg 

Ambiguous type variable `a0' in the constraints:
      (Data.Serialize.Serialize a0) arising from a use of `foo'
                                    at test_00.hs:13:15-19
      (Show a0) arising from a use of `print' at test_00.hs:17:9-13
    Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)

(msg :: Maybe String) <- cwPop token
print msg
