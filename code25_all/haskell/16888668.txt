myLast :: [a] -> a
myLast [] = error "Can't call myLast on an empty list!"
myLast (x:_) = x

Couldn't match expected type `a' with actual type `[a]'. `a' is a rigid type variable bound by the type signature for myLast :: [a] -> a
myLast :: [a] -> a
myLast [] = error "Can't call myLast on an empty list!"
myLast (_:x) = x
