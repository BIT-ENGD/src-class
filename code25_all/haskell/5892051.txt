<interactive>:1:0:
    Ambiguous type variable `t' in the constraints:
      `Floating t'
        arising from a use of `divisors' at <interactive>:1:0-10
      `Integral t'
        arising from a use of `divisors' at <interactive>:1:0-10
    Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
