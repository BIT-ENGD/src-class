-- unzip turns a list of two element tuples into two lists
unzip' [] = ([],[])
unzip' [(x,y):ls] = 
    let 
        (a, b) = unzip' ls
    in
        ([x] ++ a, [y] ++ b)

Couldn't match expected type `(t, t1)'
           against inferred type `[(t, t1)]'
      Expected type: [(t, t1)] -> (t2, t3)
      Inferred type: [[(t, t1)]] -> ([a], [a1])
    In the expression: unzip' ls
    In a pattern binding: (a, b) = unzip' ls
