threshold price qty categorySize
    | total < categorySize = "Total: " ++ total ++ " is low"
    | total < categorySize*2 = "Total: " ++ total ++ " is medium"
    | otherwise = "Total: " ++ total ++ " is high"
    where total =  price * qty

No instance for (Num [Char])
      arising from a use of `*'
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Num [Char])
    In the expression: price * qty
    In an equation for `total': total = price * qty
    In an equation for `threshold':
     ... repeats function definition
