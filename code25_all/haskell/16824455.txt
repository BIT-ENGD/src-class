fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)

main = do putStrLn "Enter a number:"
          num <- readLn
          foldr (+) 0 (take num fibs)

No instance for (Num (IO t0))
  arising from the literal `0'
Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Num (IO t0))
In the second argument of `foldr', namely `0'
In the expression: foldr (+) 0 (take num fibs)
In the expression:
  do { putStrLn "Enter a number:";
       num <- readLn;
       foldr (+) 0 (take num fibs) }
