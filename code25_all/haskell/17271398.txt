src\Main.hs:21:5:
    Couldn't match expected type `(String -> IO ()) -> String -> t0'
                with actual type `IO ()'
    The function `putStr' is applied to three arguments,
    but its type `String -> IO ()' has only one
    In the expression:
      putStr (show $ square 3) putStr (show $ fibSeries 12)
    In an equation for `main':
        main = putStr (show $ square 3) putStr (show $ fibSeries 12)
