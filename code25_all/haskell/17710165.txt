let r = read::String-> Int

read "456"

No instance for (Read a0) arising from a use of `read'
The type variable `a0' is ambiguous
Possible fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
Note: there are several potential instances:
  instance Read () -- Defined in `GHC.Read'
  instance (Read a, Read b) => Read (a, b) -- Defined in `GHC.Read'
  instance (Read a, Read b, Read c) => Read (a, b, c)
    -- Defined in `GHC.Read'
  ...plus 25 others
In the expression: read "456"
In an equation for `it': it = read "456"
