data Equality a = Equals a a 

instance (Show a) => Show (Equality a) where
show (Equals a b) = a ++ " = " ++ b

Inferred type is not general enough
*** Expression    : show
*** Expected type : Show (Equality a) => Equality a -> String
*** Inferred type : Show (Equality [Char]) => Equality [Char] -> String
