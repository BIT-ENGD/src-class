import Data.Monoid

times :: Monoid a => Int -> a -> a
times i = mconcat . replicate i

main =
  print $ times 5 5

Ambiguous type variable `a0' in the constraints:
  (Monoid a0) arising from a use of `times'
              at :7:11-15
  (Show a0) arising from a use of `print'
            at :7:3-7
  (Num a0) arising from the literal `5'
           at :7:19
Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
In the second argument of `($)', namely `times 5 5'
In the expression: print $ times 5 5
In an equation for `main': main = print $ times 5 5
