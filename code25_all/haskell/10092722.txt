data Memory a = A 
  { cameFrom :: Maybe Direction
  , lastVal :: val
  , visited :: [Direction]
  }

init :: Int -> a
init n = ((Nothing) n []) gives me the following error:


The function `Nothing' is applied to two arguments,
but its type `Maybe a0' has none
In the expression: ((Nothing) n [])
In an equation for `init': init n = ((Nothing) n [])

move :: val -> [Direction] -> Memory -> Direction
move s cs m | s < m.lastVal = m.cameFrom
            | ...

 Couldn't match expected type `Int' with actual type `a0 -> c0'
    Expected type: val
      Actual type: a0 -> c0
    In the second argument of `(<)', namely `m . lastVal'
    In the expression: s < m . lastVal

Type Cell = (Int, Int)
Type Direction = (Cell, Int)
