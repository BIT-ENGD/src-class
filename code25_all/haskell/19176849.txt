Input: A set of points.
Output: A new set of points.
Step 1: For each point, calculate the closest points in a radius.
Step 2: For each point, calculate a value "v" from the closest points subset.
Step 3: For each point, calculate a new value "w" from the closest points and
        the values "v" from the previous step, i.e, "w" depends on the neighbors
        and "v" of each neighbor.
Step 4: Update points.

struct Point {
    Vector position;
    double v, w;
    std::vector<Point *> neighbors;
};

std::vector<Point> points = initializePoints();
calculateNeighbors(points);
calculateV(points); // points[0].v = value; for example.
calculateW(points);
