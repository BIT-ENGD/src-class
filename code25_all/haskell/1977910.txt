No package 'libdc1394' found

Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
installed software in a non-standard prefix.

Alternatively, you may set the environment variables libdc1394_CFLAGS
and libdc1394_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
See the pkg-config man page for more details.
