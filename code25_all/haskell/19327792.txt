foo :: (Num x) => x -> String
foo x = show x ++ "!"

test.hs:2:9:
    Could not deduce (Show x) arising from a use of `show'
    from the context (Num x)
    bound by the type signature for foo :: Num x => x -> String
    at test.hs:1:8-29
    Possible fix:
      add (Show x) to the context of
        the type signature for foo :: Num x => x -> String

Num
Show
Eq
foo :: (Num x, Show x) => x -> String
Num
