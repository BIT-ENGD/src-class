checkstring :: [String] -> Int -> [String]
checkstring p n = do    z <- doesFileExist (p !! n)
    if z
    then p
    else error $ "'" ++ (p !! n) ++ "' file path does not exist"

Couldn't match expected type `[t0]' with actual type `IO Bool'
    In the return type of a call of `doesFileExist'
    In a stmt of a 'do' expression: z <- doesFileExist (p !! n)
