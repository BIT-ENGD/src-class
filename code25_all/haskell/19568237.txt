newtype Test a = Test (Int, a)

instance Monad Test where
    Test (_, []) >>= k =
        k []
    Test (_, a) >>= k =
        k a
    return a =
        Test (0, a)

Couldn't match expected type `a' with actual type `[t0]'
  `a' is a rigid type variable bound by
      the type signature for >>= :: Test a -> (a -> Test b) -> Test b
