    Couldn't match expected type `[a1] -> [a1]' with actual type `[a0]'
    The first argument of ($) takes one argument,
    but its type `[a0]' has none
    In the expression: 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs $ tail fibs
    In an equation for `fibs':
        fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs $ tail fibs

fibonacci.hs:1:16:
    Couldn't match expected type `[a0]' with actual type `[a1] -> [a1]'
    In the return type of a call of `zipWith'
    Probable cause: `zipWith' is applied to too few arguments
    In the second argument of `(:)', namely `zipWith (+) fibs'
    In the second argument of `(:)', namely `1 : zipWith (+) fibs'

fibs = 0 : 1 $ zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)

fibs = (0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs) $ tail fibs
