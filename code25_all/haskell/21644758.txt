Loading package gnuidn-0.2.1 ... 
GHCi runtime linker: fatal error: I found a duplicate definition for symbol
    c_isascii
whilst processing object file
    /usr/local/lib/libidn.a
This could be caused by:
    * Loading two different object files which export the same symbol
    * Specifying the same object file twice on the GHCi command line
    * An incorrect `package.conf' entry, causing some object to be loaded twice.
GHCi cannot safely continue in this situation.  Exiting now.  Sorry.
