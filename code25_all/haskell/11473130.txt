no instance for (Num [a0])
arising from a use of `zmemopascals'
Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Num [a0])
In the expression: zmemopascals 2 2
In an equation for `it': it = zmemopascals 2 2

Code:
--1 
memopascals r c =  [[pascals a b | b<-[1..c]] | a<-[1..r]] !! (r-1) !! (c-1) 
 where pascals 1 _ = 1 
       pascals _ 1 = 1 
       pascals x y = memopascals (x-1) y + memopascals x (y-1) 

--2 
--xmemopascals :: Int -> Int -> Int 
xmemopascals r c =  map (uncurry pascals) (zip [1..] [1..]) !! (r-1) !! (c-1) 
 where pascals 1 _ = 1 
       pascals _ 1 = 1 
       pascals x y = memopascals (x-1) y + memopascals x (y-1) 


--3 
zmemopascals r c =  zipWith pascals [1 ..] [1 ..] !! (r-1) !! (c-1) 
 where pascals 1 _ = 1 
       pascals _ 1 = 1 
       pascals x y = memopascals (x-1) y + memopascals x (y-1)
