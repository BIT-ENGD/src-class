Couldn't match expected type `t0 -> t1 -> t2'
            with actual type `forall b. b -> [b] -> [b]'
The lambda expression `\ (n :: Int) newVal xs -> ...'
has three arguments,
but its type `Int -> forall b. b -> [b] -> [b]' has only one

forall b. Int -> b -> [b] -> [b]
Couldn't match expected type `t0 -> t1 -> t2 -> t3'

The lambda expression `\ (n :: Int) newVal xs -> ...'
has three arguments,
but its type `forall b. Int -> b -> [b] -> [b]' has none

forall b. b -> [b] -> [b]
