foldl'' :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b

test :: Eq b => (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> Bool
test f e ls = foldl'' f e ls == foldl f e ls

quickCheck test
No instance for (Show (b0 -> a0 -> b0))
  arising from a use of `quickCheck'
Possible fix:
  add an instance declaration for (Show (b0 -> a0 -> b0))
In the expression: quickCheck prueba
In an equation for `it': it = quickCheck prueba
