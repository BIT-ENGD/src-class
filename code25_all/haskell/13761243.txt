data Color = Yellow | Red | Green | Blue | Empty deriving (Show, Eq)

newtype Color = Color Int deriving (Eq,Ord,Enum) 
(yellow:red:green:blue:empty:_) = [Color 1 ..]

Can't make a derived instance of `Enum Color':
  `Color' must be an enumeration type
  (an enumeration consists of one or more nullary, non-GADT constructors)
  Try -XGeneralizedNewtypeDeriving for GHC's newtype-deriving extension
In the newtype declaration for `Color'
