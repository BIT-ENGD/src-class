class Problem a b where
    foo :: a -> a
    bar :: b -> b
    baz :: a -> b -> (a, b)

solve :: Problem a b => a -> b -> (a, b)
solve a b = baz (foo a) (bar b)

    Ambiguous type variable `b0' in the constraint:
      (Problem a b0) arising from a use of `foo'
    Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    In the first argument of `baz', namely `(foo a)'
    In the expression: baz (foo a) (bar b)
    In an equation for `solve': solve a b = baz (foo a) (bar b)

    Ambiguous type variable `a0' in the constraint:
      (Problem a0 b) arising from a use of `bar'
    Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    In the second argument of `baz', namely `(bar b)'
    In the expression: baz (foo a) (bar b)
    In an equation for `solve': solve a b = baz (foo a) (bar b)
