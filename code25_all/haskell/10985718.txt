listtwo :: [([a],b)] -> [a]
listtwo [] = []
listtwo [(a,b)] = fst (head (tail [(a,b)]))

<interactive>:1:27:
No instance for (Num [a0])
arising from the literal `6'
Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Num [a0])
In the expression: 6
In the expression: (6, 'a')
In the first argument of `listtwo', namely
  `[(5, 'b'), (1, 'c'), (6, 'a')]'
