-- Number of digits needed for the multiplication table n*n in base 'base'
nOfDg :: Int -> Int-> Int 
nOfDg n base = 1 + floor ( logBase base (n*n)) 

No instance for (Floating Int)
     arising from a use of `logBase' at C:\haskel\dgnum.hs:4:24-38
   Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Floating Int)
   In the first argument of `floor', namely `(logBase b (n * n))'
   In the second argument of `(+)', namely `floor (logBase b (n * n))'
   In the expression: 1 + floor (logBase b (n * n))
