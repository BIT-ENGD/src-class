[minBound..1]

<interactive>:1:12:
    Ambiguous type variable `t0' in the constraints:
      (Num t0) arising from the literal `1' at <interactive>:1:12
      (Enum t0) arising from the arithmetic sequence `minBound .. 1'
                at <interactive>:1:1-13
      (Bounded t0) arising from a use of `minBound'
                   at <interactive>:1:2-9
    Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    In the expression: 1
    In the expression: [minBound .. 1]
    In an equation for `it': it = [minBound .. 1]
