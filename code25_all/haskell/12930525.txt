[("abc", 123), ("def", 456)]

check x = lookup x theMap

Couldn't match expected type `[(a0, b0)]'
            with actual type `IO [(String, Int)]'
In the second argument of `lookup', namely `theMap'

getLines :: String -> IO [String]
getLines = liftM lines . readFile

tuplify [x,y] = (x, read y :: Int)

theMap = do
    list <- getLines "./test.txt"
    let l = map tuplify (map words list)
    return l

abc 123
