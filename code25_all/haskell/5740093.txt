prop_foo :: (Num a) =>[a] -> Bool
prop_foo xs = (reverse.reverse) xs == id xs

f :: IO ()
f = quickCheck prop_foo

Ambiguous type variable `a' in the constraints:
  `Num a' arising from a use of `prop_foo' at Foo.hs:147:15-22
  `Arbitrary a'
    arising from a use of `quickCheck' at Foo.hs:147:4-22
Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)

instance Arbitrary Xxx where
    arbitrary     = ...
    coarbitrary c = ...
