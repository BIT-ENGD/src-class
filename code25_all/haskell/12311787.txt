import qualified Control.OldException as E

import qualified Control.Exception as E

    fileContents <- (readFile "shpm.txt") `E.catch` (\_ -> return "")

Ambiguous type variable `e0' in the constraint:
  (E.Exception e0) arising from a use of `E.catch'
Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
In a stmt of a 'do' block:
  fileContents <- (readFile "shpm.txt")
                  `E.catch` (\ _ -> return "No Tasks")
