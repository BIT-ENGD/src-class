soma :: Float -> Float -> Float
soma x1 x2 = x1 + x2

<interactive>:10:6:
No instance for (Num (Float -> Float -> Float))
  arising from a use of `-'
Possible fix:
  add an instance declaration for (Num (Float -> Float -> Float))
In the expression: soma - 1 2
In an equation for `it': it = soma - 1 2
