data Foo :: Nat -> * where
  SmallFoo :: (n <= 2)  => Foo n
  BigFoo   :: (3 <= n)  => Foo n

n
Foo n
n
myFoo :: Foo 4
myFoo = BigFoo

No instance for (3 <= 4) arising from a use of `BigFoo'
Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (3 <= 4)
In the expression: BigFoo
In an equation for `myFoo': myFoo = BigFoo
