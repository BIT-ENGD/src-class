ghc --make gcd

Couldn't match expected type `IO b0' with actual type `[a0]' 
In a stmt of a 'do' block:
  putStrLn "GCD is: " ++ gcd' num1 num2 ++ "TADA...."
In the expression:
  do { putStrLn "Hello,World. This is coming from Haskell";
       putStrLn "This is the GCD";
       putStrLn "Frist Number";
       input <- getLine;
       .... }
In an equation for `main':
    main
      = do { putStrLn "Hello,World. This is coming from Haskell";
             putStrLn "This is the GCD";
             putStrLn "Frist Number";
             .... }

gcd' :: (Integral a) => a -> a -> a
gcd' x y = gcd' (abs x) (abs y)
      where gcd' a 0  =  a
        gcd' a b  =  gcd' b (a `rem` b)

main = do
    putStrLn "Hello,World. This is coming from Haskell"
    putStrLn "This is the GCD"
    putStrLn "Frist Number"
    input <- getLine
    let num1 = (read input)
    putStrLn "Second Number"
    input2 <- getLine
    let num2 = read input2
    putStrLn "GCD is: " ++ gcd' num1 num2 ++ "TADA...."
