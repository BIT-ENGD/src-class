isOrdered :: (a -> a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool
isOrdered mark xs =(head xs) `mark`(head(tail xs)) 

isOrdered < [1,2,3]

Couldn't match expected type `(a0 -> a0 -> Bool) -> [a0] -> Bool'
            with actual type `[t0]'
In the second argument of `(<)', namely `[1, 2, 3]'
In the expression: isOrdered < [1, 2, 3]
In an equation for `it': it = isOrdered < [1, 2, 3]
