power.hs:6:25:
    Couldn't match expected type `Int' with actual type `Int -> Int'
    In the return type of a call of `power'
    Probable cause: `power' is applied to too few arguments
    In the expression: power (multiply (a a) b - 1)
    In an equation for `power':
        power a b
          | b == 0 = 0
          | otherwise = power (multiply (a a) b - 1)
