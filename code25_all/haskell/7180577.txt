  [[],[1],[1,2],[1,2,3],[],[2],[2,3],[],[3],[]]

  [[1],[1,2],[1,2,3],[2],[2,3],[3]]

  myfilter lst = filter(\x -> x/=[]) lst

   No instance for (Num [a])
  arising from the literal `3' at <interactive>:1:13
Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Num [a])
In the expression: 3
In the first argument of `myfilter', namely `[12, 3, []]'
In the expression: myfilter [12, 3, []]
