/path/test.hs:8:11:
    Could not deduce (Floating (a -> a)) from the context (Floating a)
      arising from a use of `test2'
                   at /path/test.hs:8:11-15
    Possible fix:
      add (Floating (a -> a)) to the context of
        the type signature for `testBoth'
      or add an instance declaration for (Floating (a -> a))
    In the first argument of `(.)', namely `test2'
    In the expression: test2 . test1
    In the definition of `testBoth': testBoth = test2 . test1
