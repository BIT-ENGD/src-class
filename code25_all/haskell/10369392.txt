      `n' is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for
            isLongerThanN' :: Integral n => n -> [a] -> Bool
          at blah.hs:140:1
    In the second argument of `(>)', namely `n'
    In the expression: length xs > n
    In an equation for `isLongerThanN'':
        isLongerThanN' n xs = length xs > n
