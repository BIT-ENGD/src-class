Couldn't match expected type `[t0]' with actual type `IO ()'
In the return type of a call of `printv'
In a stmt of a 'do' expression: px <- printv x
In the expression:
  do { px <- printv x;
       sep <- print ", ";
       rest <- prints xs;
       return (px : sep : rest) }

data    Value     = IntValue     Int
                  | TruthValue   Bool
                    deriving (Eq, Show)

printv :: Value -> IO()
printv (IntValue   i) = print i
printv (TruthValue b) = print ("boolean" ++ show b)

prints :: [Value] -> [IO()]
prints  []    =  []
prints (x:xs) = do px   <- printv x
                   sep  <- print ", "
                   rest <- prints xs
                   return (px:sep:rest)

px
