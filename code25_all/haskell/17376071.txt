--factorial

fact :: int -> int
fact 0 = 1
fact n | n > 0 = n * fact(n - 1)

main = print (fact 10)

No instance for (Ord int) arising from a use of `>'
Possible fix:
add (Ord int) to the context of
the type signature for fact :: int -> int
In the expression: n > 0
In a stmt of a pattern guard for
an equation for `fact':
n > 0
In an equation for `fact': fact n | n > 0 = n * fact (n - 1)
