map (\(a,b,c,d)->a:b:c:d) listOfTuples

Prelude> map (\(a,b,c)->a:b:c) [(1,2,3), (5,6,7)]

<interactive>:1:37:
    No instance for (Num [t])
      arising from the literal `7' at <interactive>:1:37
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Num [t])
    In the expression: 7
    In the expression: (5, 6, 7)
    In the second argument of `map', namely `[(1, 2, 3), (5, 6, 7)]'
