configure: error: Your installation of ghc does not appear to work.
  It cannot compile a simple program (see config.log for the details).
  If you installed ghc from a generic binary tarball then it is worth
  checking that you have the 'gmp' C library and header files installed.
  (On Debian-based systems this package is called libgmp3-dev.)
