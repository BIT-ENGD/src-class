let xs = [if x < 3 then "bang" else "boom" | x <- xs]

No instance for (Num [Char])
arising from the literal `3'
Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Num [Char])
In the second argument of `(<)', namely `(3)'
In the expression: x < (3)
In the expression: if x < (3) then "bang" else "boom"

let boom xs = [if x < 3 then "bang" else "boom" | x <- xs]
