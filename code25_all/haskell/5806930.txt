set2.hs:10:3:
    Could not deduce (Eq a) from the context ()
      arising from a use of `==' at set2.hs:10:3-16
    Possible fix:
      add (Eq a) to the context of
        the type signature for `deleteDuplicates'
    In the expression: x == (head xs)
        In a stmt of a pattern guard for
                 the definition of `deleteDuplicates':
          x == (head xs)
    In the definition of `deleteDuplicates':
        deleteDuplicates (x : xs)
                           | x == (head xs) = x : (deleteDuplicates (tail xs))
                           | otherwise = x : (head xs) : (deleteDuplicates (tail xs))
