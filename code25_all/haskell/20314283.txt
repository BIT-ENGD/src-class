xs = filter isMaxVal
where 
            isMaxVal xs = valueFcn xs == maxVal
Here isMaxVal is defined as a function that takes xs as an argument but how is that possible xs is an agrument of filter.
if we change valueFcn  to function length 
we get 
 isMaxVal xs = length xs == maxVal
if xs is ["cs", "efd", "lth", "it"] length of this is 4 but maxVal ==3 
 maxVal = maximum (map length ["cs", "efd", "lth", "it"]) ==3




-- maximaBy length ["cs", "efd", "lth", "it"] == ["efd", "lth"]
    maximaBy :: Ord b => (a -> b) -> [a] -> [a]
    maximaBy valueFcn xs = filter isMaxVal xs
        where 
            isMaxVal xs = valueFcn xs == maxVal
            maxVal = maximum (map valueFcn xs)
