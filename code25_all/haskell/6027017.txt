data SomeData =  SInteger Integer | SElse deriving Show

class Some a where
    toSome :: a -> SomeData

instance Some Int where toSome = SInteger . toInteger

main :: IO ()
main = print $ toSome 3

Ambiguous type variable `a0' in the constraints:
      (Some a0) arising from a use of `toSome'
                at minimal_broken.hs:11:16-21
      (Num a0) arising from the literal `3' at minimal_broken.hs:11:23
    Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
