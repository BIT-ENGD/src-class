      lookUp :: Char -> [(Char, Char)] -> Char
      lookUp x [] = x
      lookUp x ( ( st,nd ): rst) | st == x = nd
                   | otherwise = lookUp x rst

No instance for (Show ([(Char, Char)] -> Char))
arising from a use of `print'
 Possible fix:
  add an instance declaration for (Show ([(Char, Char
  In a stmt of an interactive GHCi command: print it
