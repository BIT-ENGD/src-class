Configuring SDL-mpeg-0.0.1...
cabal: Missing dependency on a foreign library:
* Missing header file: smpeg.h
This problem can usually be solved by installing the system package that
provides this library (you may need the "-dev" version). If the library is
already installed but in a non-standard location then you can use the flags
--extra-include-dirs= and --extra-lib-dirs= to specify where it is.
cabal: Error: some packages failed to install:
SDL-mpeg-0.0.1 failed during the configure step. The exception was:
exit: ExitFailure 1
