mag :: (Floating b, Num a) => (a,a) -> b
mag (x,y) = sqrt (x**2 + y**2)

Couldn't match expected type `b' against inferred type `a'
  `b' is a rigid type variable bound by
      the type signature for `mag' at tone.hs:1:17
  `a' is a rigid type variable bound by
      the type signature for `mag' at tone.hs:1:24
In the expression: sqrt (x ** 2 + y ** 2)
In the definition of `mag': mag (x, y) = sqrt (x ** 2 + y ** 2)
