class Three a where
    three :: a -> [a]

instance (Three a) => Three [a] where
    three x = [x, x, x]

*Main> three ['c']

<interactive>:11:1:
    No instance for (Three Char)
      arising from a use of `three'
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Three Char)
    In the expression: three ['c']
    In an equation for `it': it = three ['c']

<interactive>:12:8:
    Ambiguous type variable `t0' in the constraints:
      (Num t0) arising from the literal `1' at <interactive>:12:8
      (Three t0) arising from a use of `three' at <interactive>:12:1-5
    Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    In the expression: 1
    In the first argument of `three', namely `[1, 2]'
    In the expression: three [1, 2]
