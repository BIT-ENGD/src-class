 This is where I need to know how to retrieve the information from the
 above command(comm). I am looking for something similiar to php's
 mysql_result. I want to access the records kind of like an array or some
 other form of retrieving all the data.
 Also when the new SqlCommand is called...does that actual run the
 SELECT STATEMENT or is there another step.
