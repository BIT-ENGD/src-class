ArtistFans
    ArtistFanID (PK)
    ArtistID (FK)
    UserID (FK)

 (ArtistID and UserID will then be contrained with a Unique Constraint 
  to prevent duplicate data) 

ArtistFans
    ArtistID (PK)
    UserID (PK)

(The need for the separate unique constraint is removed because of the 
 compound PK)
