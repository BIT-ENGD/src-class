Table1
    rowId int, primary key
    someData1 int
    someData2 int...

Table2
    id int, primary key
    rowId ==> int, refers to the rowId from Table1
    someCalculatedData int...

    Table2.rowId is not a foreign key, but I did make a Non-clustered, Non-Unique index on it

select TOP 250000 rowId from Table1 
       where NOT EXISTS (select rowId from Table2 where Table1.rowId=Table2.rowId)
