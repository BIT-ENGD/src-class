Algorithm
  Input:  Start date, End date
  Output: Worst position the account is going to be in in the future.

  WorstPosition = 0 //only want worst position if it is negative.
  For each date D between start date and end date where a transaction takes place
     Position_D = Sum deposits and withdrawls between start date and D
         If Position_D < WorstPosition
     WorstPosition =  Position_D
