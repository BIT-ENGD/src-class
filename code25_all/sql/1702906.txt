python manage.py reset app

Error: Error: app couldn't be reset. Possible reasons:
  * The database isn't running or isn't configured correctly.
  * At least one of the database tables doesn't exist.
  * The SQL was invalid.
Hint: Look at the output of 'django-admin.py sqlreset app'. That's the SQL this command wasn't able to run.
The full error: cannot drop table app_record because other objects depend on it
HINT:  Use DROP ... CASCADE to drop the dependent objects too.

class Record(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50, db_index=True)
    year = models.IntegerField(blank=True, null=True)
    def __unicode__(self):
        return self.name

class Class(models.Model):
    record = models.ForeignKey(Record)
    def __unicode__(self):
        return self.id

python manage.py dbshell 
# drop table app_record cascade; 
# \q 
python manage.py reset app
