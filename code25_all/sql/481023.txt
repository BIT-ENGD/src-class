// Note: before delving into this section, make sure you've read the preceding two
// sections: Select and SelectMany. The Join operators are actually unnecessary
// in LINQ to SQL, and the equivalent of SQL inner and outer joins is most easily
// achieved in LINQ to SQL using Select/SelectMany and subqueries!
