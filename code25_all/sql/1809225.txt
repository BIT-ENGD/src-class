Query 1:
    select dbresultsid, TestCase, BuildID, Analyzed,
         Verdict, 
         (select count(Verdict) from results where BuildID = 'Beta1' 
                 and Verdict = 'PASS') AS PASS, 
         (select count(Verdict) from results where BuildID = 'Beta1' 
                 and Verdict = 'FAIL') AS FAIL, 
         (select count(Verdict) from results where BuildID = 'Beta1' 
                 and Verdict = 'INCONC') AS INCONC, 
         (select count(Verdict) from results where BuildID = 'Beta1' 
                 and Verdict = 'TIMEOUT') AS TIMEOUT 
    from results 
    where BuildID = 'Beta1'       
    group by TestCase,dbresultsid 
    order by Analyzed

Query 2:

select dbresultsid, TestCase, BuildID, Analyzed,
         Verdict, 
(case when Verdict='PASS' then count(Verdict) else 0 end) as PASS,
(case when Verdict='FAIL' then count(Verdict) else 0 end) as FAIL,
(case when Verdict='INCONC' then count(Verdict) else 0 end) as INCONC,
(case when Verdict='TIMEOUT' then count(Verdict) else 0 end) as TIMEOUT
from results
where 
BuildID = 'Beta1'
group by TestCase,dbresultsid 
order by Analyzed


Results :
for Query 1:
if the total number of PASS = 20,
 then PASS column will display 20 everywhere.

Results :
for Query 2:
