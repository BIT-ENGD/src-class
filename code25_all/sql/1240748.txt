Based on thomas' suggestion I converted my query to:
select distinct a.user_id as 'User ID',
       a.project_id as 'Remix Project Id',
       prjs.based_on_pid as 'Original Project ID',
       (case when f.reasons is NULL then 'N' else 'Y' end)
         as 'Flagged Y or N',
       f.reasons, f.timestamp, min(a.timestamp)
from view_stats a
     join (select id, based_on_pid, user_id
                    from projects p) prjs on
     (a.project_id = prjs.id)
     left outer join flaggers f on
     (    f.project_id = a.project_id
      and f.user_id = a.user_id)
where a.project_id in
(select distinct b.id
   from projects b
  where b.based_on_pid in
                ( select distinct c.id
                    from projects c
                   where c.user_id = a.user_id
                )
)
group by a.project_id, a.user_id
order by a.timestamp
;
