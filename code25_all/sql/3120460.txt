SELECT        Set.ID as expr1
FROM SkillSet
WHERE Skill.ID = @SkillID
//this selects every set containing the Skill.


SELECT         Contact.ID
FROM           ContactSet
WHERE SET.ID = ?
//this is where I run into problems. I want to use the records returned from
//the previous SELECT query (expr1) but I'm unsure how. 
//Would it be expr1.ID or expr1.Set.ID?
