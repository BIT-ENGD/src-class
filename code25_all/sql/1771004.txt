unmatched_purchases table:

customer_id

credit_card_transactions:

trans_timestamp --timestamp of when the transaction occurred
item_id --item purchased
customer_id
location_id

1) same customer_id
2) same item_id
3) the trans_timestamp is within a certain window of the purchase_date
  (EG if the purchase_date is Jan 3, 2005 
  and the trans_timestamp is 11:14PM Jan 2, 2005, that's close enough)
