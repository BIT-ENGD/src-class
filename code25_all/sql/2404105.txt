  Here,
  I want to check if @StartDate is NOT in output A then replace it with the last known date. In this case, since @startdate is less than any date in output A hence @StartDate will become 02/01/2010.

  Also to check if @EndDate is NOT in output A then replace it with the last known date. In this case, since @enddate is 02/06/2010 hence it will be replace with 02/05/2010.

  // Here there is a query using @startDate and @EndDate.

)

Name   Date   
A      02/01/2010  
B      02/01/2010  
C      02/05/2010  
D      02/10/2010
