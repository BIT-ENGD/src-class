SELECT RequestsID, Country, Activity,
[People needed (each day)], [Start date], [End date]
FROM dbo.Requests

From Requests,
show Country and SUM 'People needed'
where (column not in Requests table-Date) is a Date (will be
a number of dates, I want to set the scope by a Start and End date)
and Requests.Country is @Country 
(and the Date(s) above of course is between the Requests Start date and End date...)
And from (a non existing table...?) show Date
Group by Country
