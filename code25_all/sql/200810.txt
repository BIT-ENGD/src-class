things table:
id   group_id   name
1    1          thing 1
2    1          thing 2
3    1          thing 3
4    1          thing 4
5    2          thing 5

access table:
user_id  type   object_id  access
1        group  1          50
1        thing  1          10
1        thing  2          100

desired result:
thing_id   access
1          10
2          100
3          50   (things 3 and 4 have no specific access rule,
4          50   so this '50' is from the group rule)
5               (thing 5 has no rules at all, so although I 
                still want it in the output, there's no access
        level for it)

SELECT * 
FROM things 
LEFT JOIN access ON 
    user_id = 1
    AND (
        (access.type = 'group' AND access.object_id = things.group_id)
        OR (access.type = 'thing' AND access.object_id = things.id)
    )
