1. Receives a request, as a XML string, from the client.

2. Validates the messages ( !null && !empty mainly).

3. Unmarshalls the message into a Request object.

4. Validates the internals of the Request object (ensures all the required fields are there, ie. id, requestName etc).

5. If valid, create a specific request (I receive a lot of extra information in the original request and I need a very small subset of it to process the request).

6. Process the request and retrieve the output.

7. Send the output to the client.

Controller{

processMessage(String requestMsg){
boolean isValid = validator.validate(requestMsg);
Request request = creator.createRequest(requestMsg);
isValid = validator.validate(request);
processor.processRequest();

}
