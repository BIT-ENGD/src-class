* Test 1 (0.0 out of 1)

      Person.java:15: getAge(int) in Person cannot be applied to ()
              String s = (p.getAge() == 16 ? "getAge() Correct" : "getAge() not Correct");
                           ^
      1 error
      The output should have been:
          getAge() Correct

      This is what was actually produced:
          Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Person
