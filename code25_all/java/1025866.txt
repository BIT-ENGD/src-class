1. Starts with a 3D matrix of gray scale image slices representing a single area
2. Does a medfilt1 to even out each slice. 
3. Does some imopen, imclose and imadjust operations on the image to remove some fuzziness, 
4. Does some simple thresholding in various areas to find boundary points
5. Fits splines to the boundary points, 
6. Uses the 3rd dimension in various ways to further perfect the point matching, especially using medfilt2. 
7. Saves each slice with the boundary splines written in color on it.
