abc a = new abc();
a.setAttribute("aaaa");
.........
a...is no longer being used...and has not yet been garbage collected by the JVM. There are multiple threads creating 5000 instances of class abc..
again, abc a = new abc();
       Sysout(a.getAttribute()); // This prints "aaaa" set for an earlier instance!
