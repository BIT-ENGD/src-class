I am using Apache fop-0.95 to build pdf files from a JSP web application on IBM iSeries V5R4 using Websphere 6.0.  Everything works perfect in my development using Websphere Development Studio client.  When I put the application on the server, I get an error at this line.

    FopFactory fopFactory = FopFactory.newInstance();

The error is:

    java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: javax/imageio/ImageIO

Does anyone know how I can fix this error?

All of the fop class files are part of the EAR file.  The files were installed to the projects \WEB-INF\lib directory.  I have added the fop jar files to the classpath, using the admin console. 

I am running IBM WebSphere Application Server - Express, 6.0.2.9
