// This is for HW problem #3
// An application that asks the user to enter two 
// integers, obtains them from the user and prints their sum, 
// product, difference and quotient (division). 

import java.utl.Scanner; //program uses class Scanner

public class Solution
{ 
  // main method begins execution of Java application
  public static void ( String ags [] )
  {
    // create Scanner to obtain input from command window
    Scanner input = new Scanner ( System.in );

   int number1; //first integer to add
   int number2; //second integer to add
   int sum; // sum of number1 and number2
   int product; //product of number 1 and number2
   int differnec; //difference of number1 and number2
   int quotient; //quotient of number1 and number2

   System.out.print( "Enter first integer: " ); // prompt
   number1 = input.nextInt(); // read first number from user

   System.out.print( "Enter second integer: " ); // prompt
   number2 = input.nextInt(); // read second number from user

   sum = number1 + number 2; // add numbers
   product = number1 * number2; // multiply numbers
   difference = number1 - number2; // subtract numbers
   quotient = number1 / number2; // divide numbers

   System.out.printf( " Sum is %d\n ", sum ); //display sum

   System.out.printf( " Product is %d\n ", product ); //display prouduct

   System.out.printf( " Difference is %d\n ", difference ); //display difference

   System.out.printf( " Quotient is %d\n ", quotient ); //display quotient

  } // end method main
