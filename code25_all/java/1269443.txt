1. Client through the UI requests for price.
2. My server accepts the message, formats it and then asynchronously
   sends to the analytical server.
3. When the response from the analytical server arrives, format and send
   the response to the client UI.
4. If the client likes the price, he/she will request to trade.
5. Repeat steps 2 & 3.

1. Allow me to tune the size of the thread pools. 
2. Further, if needed, I can publish the messages contained in these queues
   thus allowing me to monitor all the messages that flows through my server.
