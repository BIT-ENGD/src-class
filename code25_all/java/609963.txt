// a and b are some objects that implement Runnable
// they both reference the same third object

// a is run in a thread and processes some data in a loop for a long time
// the method the loop belongs to is declared synchronized

a.someSyncedMethod(); // this would block ...
b.ref.someOtherSyncedMethod(); // ... but would this?
a.ref.someOtherSyncedMethod(); // ... and how about this?
