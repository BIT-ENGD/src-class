ScheduledExecutorService.html#scheduleAtFixedRate()
1.00 o'clock: scheduleAtFixedRate(MyRunnable, "Run ever Hour")`
//1.30 o'clock: MyRunnable Has finished (everthing is fine)
2.00 o'clock: MyRunnable is triggered to run again
3.00 o'clock: MyRunnable has NOT yet finished ==> What will happen here? 
Will java Simply SKIP the starting of MyRunnable (as the old instance has not yet 
finished) and try again at 4 o'clock or will Java start a NEW MyRunnable that then will 
run in parallel to the "old" MyRunnable.
