User control .ascx

On Page_Load
-> First time load
    --> I set a value to a hidden input type variable
    --> I set a value to a ViewState object (using ViewState["test"] = "test")
-> Subsequent post backs
    --> Hidden var still persists
    --> ViewState is NULL !! (Why?)

If i move the code from Page_Load to Oninit:
-> Subsequent post backs
   --> Both hidden var and Viewstate is NULL!
