Type Demo.IFooService is abstract.
As such, it is not possible to instansiate it as implementation of Demo.IFooService service

Container.Register(Component.For<IFooService>()
.Named("FooService")
.ActAs(new DefaultClientModel
  {
    EndPoint = WcfEndPoint.BoundTo(new BasicHttpBinding())
               .At("http://localhost/services/fooservice.svc")
  }
 ));
