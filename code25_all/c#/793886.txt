    WRN: Assembly binding logging is turned OFF. To enable assembly bind failure logging, set the registry value 
    [HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Fusion!EnableLog] (DWORD) to 1. Note: There is some performance penalty associated 
    with assembly bind failure logging. To turn this feature off, remove the registry value 
    [HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Fusion!EnableLog].
