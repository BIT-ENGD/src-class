     The document was understood, but it could not be processed.
  - The WSDL document contains links that could not be resolved.
  - There was an error downloading ...
  - Unable to connect to remote server
  - No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it

    Content Type application/soap+xml; charset=utf-8 was not supported by service .  The client and service bindings may be mismatched.
    The remote server returned an error: (415) Cannot process the message because the content type 'application/soap+xml; charset=utf-8' was not the expected type 'text/xml; charset=utf-8'..
    If the service is defined in the current solution, try building the solution and adding the service reference again.
