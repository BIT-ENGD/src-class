In your metadata class, set the Id to the following:

[ScaffoldColumn(false)]
public object Id { get; set; }

In case you don't have a reference to the metadata class, you add this by adding the attribute to the partial class, something like this:

[MetadataType(typeof(MyEntityFromTable_MD))]
public partial class MyEntityFromTable
{

}

Then you need the metadata class itself. Something like:

public class MyEntityFromTable_MD
{
        [ScaffoldColumn(false)]
        public object Id;
}
