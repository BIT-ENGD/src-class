 PHP Warning: Unknown: It is not safe to rely on the system's timezone settings. 
 You are    *required* to use the date.timezone setting or 
the date_default_timezone_set()
function. In case you used any of those methods and you are still getting 
this warning, 
you most likely misspelled the timezone identifier.
