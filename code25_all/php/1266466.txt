$mystring = "<<<EOT";

$mystring = <<<EOT
   This is some PHP text.
   It is completely free
   I can use "double quotes"
   and 'single quotes',
   plus $variables too, which will
   be properly converted to their values,
   you can even type EOT, as long as it
   is not alone on a line, like this:
EOT;

<?php

$mystring = <<<WHATEVER
   This is some PHP text.
WHATEVER;
?>

T_ENCAPSED_AND_WHITESPACE
if(x == y){$('#my_image').hide():}
<?php
<?
<q>
</q>
