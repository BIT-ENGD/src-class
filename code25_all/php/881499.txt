exec('hg clone ...', $output, $return_value);

Note: If a program is started with this function, in order for it to continue running in the background, the output of the program must be redirected to a file or another output stream. Failing to do so will cause PHP to hang until the execution of the program ends.

exec('hg clone 2>&1 $some_file', $output, $return_value);
