WARNING!  The include_path defined in the currently used php.ini does not
contain the PEAR PHP directory you just specified:
</usr/local/PEAR>
If the specified directory is also not in the include_path used by
your scripts, you will have problems getting any PEAR packages working.

Would you like to alter php.ini </private/etc/php.ini>? [Y/n] :

php.ini </private/etc/php.ini> include_path updated.

Current include path           : .:/usr/share/pear
Configured directory           : /usr/local/PEAR
Currently used php.ini (guess) : /private/etc/php.ini

The 'pear' command is now at your service at /usr/local/bin/pear

** The 'pear' command is not currently in your PATH, so you need to
** use '/usr/local/bin/pear' until you have added
** '/usr/local/bin' to your PATH environment variable.

Run it without parameters to see the available actions, try 'pear list'
to see what packages are installed, or 'pear help' for help.

Thanks for using go-pear!
