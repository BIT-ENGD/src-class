// this is just a sample of what I was thinking:
class Foobar
{
    const TYPE_1 = 'type 1';
    protected $_types = array(
        self::TYPE_1
    );

    public function setType($value)
    {
        // check to make sure value is a valid type
        // I'm thinking it should be able to accept
        // Foobar::TYPE_1, 'TYPE_1', or 'type 1'
        // for flexibility sake. But I don't know
    }
}

$foobar = new Foobar();
$foobar->setType('TYPE_1'); //what should go here? (best practice)
