# models.py

class Item(models.Model):
    sku = models.CharField(max_length=20)

class Attribute(models.Model):
    item = models.ForeignKey(Item, related_name='items')

# views.py

some_object.items.create(sku='123abc')

# Is there a place / way that this could cause errors, like:
# AttributeError: Bound method 'items' has no attribute "create"
# Since items() on a dict-like object could be a method to return a list,
# and Django could add support for .items() on a queryset right?
