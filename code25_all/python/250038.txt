PySmell is a python IDE completion helper. 

It tries to statically analyze Python source code, without executing it,
and generates information about a project's structure that IDE tools can
use.

The first target is Vim, because that's what I'm using and because its
completion mechanism is very straightforward, but it's not limited to it.
