ExtractionError: Can't extract file(s) to egg cache

The following error occurred while trying to extract file(s) to the Python egg
cache:

  [Errno 20] Not a directory: '/Library/WebServer/.python-eggs/MySQL_python-1.2.2-py2.5-macosx-10.5-i386.egg-tmp'

The Python egg cache directory is currently set to:

  /Library/WebServer/.python-eggs

Perhaps your account does not have write access to this directory?  You can
change the cache directory by setting the PYTHON_EGG_CACHE environment
variable to point to an accessible directory.
