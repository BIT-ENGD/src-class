Pseudorandom number generators
Most, if not all programming languages have libraries that include a pseudo-random
number generator. This generator usually returns a random number between 0 and 1 (not
including 1). In a perfect generator all numbers have the same probability of being selected but
in the pseudo generators some numbers have zero probability.
