- Print instructions to the user  
-Start with high = 1000, low = 1, and tries = 1 
- While high is greater than low   
  - Guess the average of high and low  
  - Ask the user to respond to the guess  
  - Handle the four possible outcomes:  
    - If the guess was right, print a message that tries guesses were required and quit the program
    - If the guess was too high, set high to one less than the guess that was displayed to the user and increment tries  
    - If the guess was too low, set low to one more than the guess that was displayed to the user and increment tries
    - If the user entered an incorrect value, print out the instructions again
- high and low must be equal, so print out the answer and the value of tries

def main(x, nums, low, high):
        input("Enter -1 if the guess needs to be lower, 0 if the guess was right, or 1 if the guess needs to be higher: ")
    for i in range (1, 1001):

main()
