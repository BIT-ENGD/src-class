photos : Photo.objects.all()
forms = {}
for photo in photos:
  forms[photo.id] = PhotoForm()


{% for photo in photos %}
         {% include "photoview.html" %}
         {% comment %}
    So here I want to use the photo.id as an index to get the correct form.  So that each photo has its own form.  I would want to have a different action and each form field would be unique.  Is that possible?  How can I iterate on that?  Thanks!
Would it be a with?  In Python of course it's form = forms[photo.id] but here?
         {% endcomment %}
         
            Quantity: {{ oi.quantity }} {{ form.quantity }}
            Dimensions: {{ oi.size }} {{ form.size }}
             
              
    {% endfor %}
