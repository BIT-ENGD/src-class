man poll
   poll()  performs a similar task to select(2): it waits for one of a set
   of file descriptors to become ready to perform I/O.

                 Writing now will not block.

man select
A file descriptor  is considered ready if it is possible to perform the corre‚Äê
sponding I/O operation (e.g., read(2)) without blocking.
