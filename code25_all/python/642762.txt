@aDecorator
def myfunc1():
  # do something here

if __name__ = "__main__":
  # this will call the function and will use the decorator @aDecorator
  myfunc1() 
  # now I want the @aDecorator to be replaced with the decorator @otherDecorator
  # so that when this code executes, the function no longer goes through
  # @aDecorator, but instead through @otherDecorator. How can I do this?
