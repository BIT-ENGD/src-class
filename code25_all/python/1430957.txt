def rule(x):
   rule = bin(x)[2:].zfill(8)
   while i < len(rule(x)):
         if rule[i] == '0'
            ruleList = {i:'OFF'}
         elif rule[i] == '1'
           ruleList = {i:'ON'}
         i = i + 1
    return ruleList

Input: 30
1. Converts to '00011110' (So far, so good)..
2. Checks if rule(30)[i] is '0' or '1' ('0' in this case where i = 0) 
3. Then puts the result in a key value pair, where the index of the
string is the key and the state (on
or off) is the value. 
4. The end result would be 'ruleList', where print ruleList
would yield something like this:
{0:'Off',1:'Off',2:'Off',3:'On',4:'On',5:'On',6:'On',7:'Off'}
