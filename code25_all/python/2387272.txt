===MODULE TYPE===
Since the vast majority of my modules are "library" types, I have constructed
this example skeleton as such. For modules that act as the main entry for
running the full application, you would make changes such as running a main()
function instead of the test() function in __main__.

===VERSIONING===
The following practice, specified in PEP 8, no longer makes sense:

   __version__ = '$Revision: 1.2.3 $'

For two reasons:
    (1) Distributed version control systems make it neccessary to include more
        than just a revision number. E.g. author name and revision number.
    (2) It's a revision number not a version number.


Instead, the __vcs_id__ variable is being adopted. This expands to, for
example:
    __vcs_id__ = '$Id: example.py,v 1.1.1.1 2001/07/21 22:14:04 goodger Exp $'


===VCS DATE===
Likewise, the date variable has been removed:

    __date__ = '$Date: 2009/01/02 20:19:18 $'


===CHARACTER ENCODING===
If the coding is explicitly specified, then it should be set to the default
setting of ASCII. This can be modified if necessary (rarely in practice).
Defaulting to UTF-8 can cause anomalies with editors that have poor unicode
support.
