tArgs
1.The computer starts a program using the startup file.

2.Using the "write()" command the program asks for a command to run with parameters.

3.The user types for ex. "echo yes"

4.The program then takes the word "echo" and assigns it to "var1" and then the
 word: "yes" and assigns it to "var2"

5.The program takes "var1" and "var2" and inputs it to the "shell.run()" command in the
 format: shell.run((var1),(var2))

6.The "shell.run()" calls a program named "echo" which is set up to allow
  for parameters to be entered without a prompt by using the "tArgs = {...}" command
  and the "echo" program sees that it is getting an argument "yes" and runs the
  command: "print(tArgs[1])"

------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1.At the CraftOS the startup file runs a program "cmd"

[[Program: startup]]

shell.run("cmd")

[[end of startup]]

--2.Runs program "cmd"

[[Program: cmd]]

-- Now in cmd

term.clear()
term.setCursorPos(1,1)

function prompt()

write(">") --assuming user typed: echo yes
tArgs = {...}

file = tArgs[1] --will get the word "echo"
param1 = tArgs[2] --will get the word "yes"

if #tArgs < 1 then

    print(Syntax: <command> <parameters>)
    prompt()
else
    print()
    shell.run((file), (param1)) --resulting command is shell.run("echo","yes")
    print()
    prompt()
end
end

prompt()

[[end of cmd]]

--3.Runs the program "echo" because it was the first word in our command.

[[Program: echo]]

tArgs = {...}
param = tArgs[1]

print(param) --prints "yes" which is what the "shell.run((file), (param1)) is referring to.

[[end of echo]]

>echo yes

yes

>

--4.Then because functions return after completion it should loop back into function prompt().
