    function capTo1or0 (Tensor3d)

       tensor_width=Tensor3d:size()[2]
       tensor_height=Tensor3d:size()[3]
       tensor_depth=Tensor3d:size()[1]
       for i=1,tensor_width,1 do
           for j=1,tensor_height,1 do
               for k=1,tensor_depth,1 do 
                   if(Tensor3d[k][i][j])>1 then

                       Tensor3d[k][i][j]=1

                   end  
                   if(Tensor3d[k][i][j]<0.0) then
                        Tensor3d[k][i][j]=0.0           
                   end
               end
           end
        end
       return Tensor3d
    end

An example in this is say that I have a `2-3-3` array with the values

    [1,  2,  0.5][0.5,0.2,-0.2]
     [0.1,0.2,0.3][1,  1,   1  ]
    [-2, -1, 2  ][0.2,-5,-1   ]

then I expect an outcome of 
    [1,  1,  0.5][0.5,0.2,0]
    [0.1,0.2,0.3][1,  1,   1  ]
    [0, 0, 1  ]  [0.2,0,-1   ]
