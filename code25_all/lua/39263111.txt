local fireTimer

local function onTouch( event )

  if( event.phase == "began") then
    fireTimer = timer.performWithDelay( 3000, fire, 0 ) <-- works fine

  elseif( event.phase == "ended" ) then
    timer.cancel( fireTimer ) <-- doesn't work, it keeps going, "pause" doesn't work either

  end
end

player:addEventListener( "touch", onTouch )
