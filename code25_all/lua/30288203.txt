my_mat = magic(3); % returns a 3 by 3 matrix with the numbers 1 through 9
greater_than_fives = find(my_mat > 5); % find indices of all values greater than 5, the " > 5" is a logical elementwise operator that returns a matrix of all 0's and 1's and finally the "find" command picks out the indices with a "1" in them
my_mat(greater_than_fives) = 0;  % set all values greater than 5 equal to 0
