std::map<int, char> example = {
                                (1, 'a'),
                                (2, 'b'),
                                (3, 'c') 
                              };

deducing from brace-enclosed initializer list requires #include <initializer_list>
in C++98 ‘example’ must be initialized by constructor, not by ‘{...}’
