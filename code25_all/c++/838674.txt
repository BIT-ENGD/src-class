If the value of the operand of the delete-expression is not a null pointer value, the delete-expression will
call a deallocation function (3.7.4.2). Otherwise, it is unspecified whether the deallocation function will be
called. [ Note: The deallocation function is called regardless of whether the destructor for the object or some
element of the array throws an exception. â€”end note ]
