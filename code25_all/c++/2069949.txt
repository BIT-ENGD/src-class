while (*ptr != '\0') {
   do something
}

#define ARRAY_SIZE 10
double someArray[ARRAY_SIZE] = {0};
double *ptr = someArray;
// then not sure what to do here?  I guess I am looking for an equivalent of the above while loop, but don't want to just do:
for (int i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE); *ptr++) 
cout << *ptr;
