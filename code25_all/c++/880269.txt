//Some member variable of object-b is passed-by-pointer to object-a
//When object-b is deleted, that member variable is also deleted
//In my unit test code, I want to reproduce this
//even if I explicitly call delete on object-b
//accessBMemberVariable should coredump, but it doesn't
//I'm assuming even though object-b is deleted, it's still intact in memory
A *a = new A();

  B *b = new B(a);
