The semantic checking of a default argument for a template parameter is done if and (only) when that default argument is actually used. In particular, as long as we refrain from using the default template argument Cmp<T> we can compare() strings of a type for which Cmp<X> wouldn't compile (say, because < wasn't defined for an X). This point is crucial in the design of the standard containers, which rely on a template argument to specify default values.
