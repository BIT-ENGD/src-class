tcgetattr: Inappropriate ioctl for device

-t      Force pseudo-tty allocation.  This can be used to execute arbitrary
        screen-based programs on a remote machine, which can be very useful, 
        e.g., when implementing menu services.  Multiple -t options force tty
        allocation, even if ssh has no local tty.
