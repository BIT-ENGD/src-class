expression goal(x = 4);

game.init(){ expression goal = FileRead(goalfile); }
game.checkstate(){ if(goal) exit(1); } //exit 1 is the games win state

//another more specific eg.:
class level1 { public: expression goal(total_enemies == 0); };
class level2 { public: expression goal(player.x == goal.x && player.y == goal.y); };
