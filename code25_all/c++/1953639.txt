warning C4244: '=' : conversion from 'SOCKET' to 'int', possible loss of data

#ifdef _WIN32
 typedef SOCKET sock_t;
#else
 typedef int sock_t;
#endif


/*
 * Even though sizeof(SOCKET) is 8, it's safe to cast it to int, because
 * the value constitutes an index in per-process table of limited size
 * and not a real pointer.
