Write a class named Car that has the following member variables:

    year. An int that holds the car's model year.
    make. A string that holds the make of the car.
    speed. An int that holds the car's current speed.

In addition, the class should have the following member functions.

    Constructor.  The constructor should accept the car's year and make 
        as arguments and assign these values to the object's year and 
        make member variables.  The constructor should initialize the 
        speed member variable to 0.

    Accessors.  Appropriate accessor functions should be created to allow 
        values to be retrieved from an object's year, make, and speed 
        member variables.

    accelerate.  The accelerate function should add 5 to the speed member 
        variable each time it is called.

    brake.  The brake function should subtract 5 from the speed member 
        variable each time it is called.

Demonstrate the class in a program that creates a Car object, and then 
    calls the accelerate function five times.  After each call to the 
    accelerate function, get the current speed of the car and display 
    it.  Then, call the brake function five times.  After each call to 
    the brake function, get the current speed of the car and display it.

#include<iostream>
#include<string>

using namespace std;

class Car
{
    public:
        int year;
        string make;
        int speed;
    Car()
    {
        setYear(newYear);
        setMake(newMake);
        setSpeed(0);
    }

    void setYear(int newYear)
    {
        year = newYear;
    }
    void setMake(string newMake)
    {
        make = newMake;
    }
    int getYear()
    {
        return year;
    }
    string getMake()
    {
        return make;
    }
    int accelerate(int speed)
    {
        return (speed+5);
    }
    int brake(int speed)
    {
        return (speed-5);
    }
};

int main()
{
    return 0;
}
