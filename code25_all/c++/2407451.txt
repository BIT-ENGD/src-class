//step 1: build a list of unique vertices
for each triangle
   for each vertex in triangle
      if not vertex in listOfVertices
         Add vertex to listOfVertices

//step 2: build a list of faces 
for each triangle
   for each vertex in triangle
      Get Vertex Index From listOfvertices
      AddToMap(vertex Index, triangle)
