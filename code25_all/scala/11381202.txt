abstract class Room {
 ...
}

class RoomA1 extends Room { //"not found: type Room" 
//but they're in the same package!!!
//and if I import it as Eclipse suggests the import declaration will give 
//"Room is not a member of rooms(rooms.type)"
 ...
}

var room = new Array[Room](2)
room(0) = new RoomA1 //gives a type mismatch 
//how can I accomplish this?
