class A {
  // do some stuff before child constructor is called
  // ...

  // do some other stuff after child constructor is called
  // this could be a method or inline in the constructor, doesn't matter.
}    

class B extends A { // stuff happens in between }

class C extends A { // stuff happens in between }
etc 

val b = new B // everything happens inside, no other method call needed
