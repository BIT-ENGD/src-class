 def foo(x:Int, f:Unit=>Int) = println(f())

//case1
def loop:Int = 7
foo(2, loop) //does not compile

changing loop to 
//case 2
def loop():Int = 7
foo(2, loop) // does not compile

changing loop to
//case 3
def loop(x:Unit): Int = 7 //changing according to Don's Comments
foo(2,loop) // compiles and works fine

def foo(x:Int, y:()=>Int)
