Search string : variable.method()
Original :variable+ " is in " + variable.method() + " and " + variable.method2()
Formatted :variable+ " is in " + variable.method() + " and " + variable.method2()
//EXPECTED OUTPUT: variable+ " is in " + xxx + " and " + variable.method2()
---
Search string : variable.method2()
Original :variable+ " is in " + variable.method() + " and " + variable.method2()
Formatted :variable+ " is in " + variable.method() + " and " + variable.method2()
//EXPECTED OUTPUT:variable+ " is in " + variable.method() + " and " + xxx 
---
Search string : variable.method()
Original :variable.method()+ " has " + variable + " and " + variable.method2()
Formatted :variable.method()+ " has " + variable + " and " + variable.method2()
