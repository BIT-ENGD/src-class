object Obj {
    def method(x:Int) = 1 to x
    type ReturnType = ???

    //possible solution if i know a parameter for which the method won't fail
    val x = method(1)
    type ReturnType = x.type

    //another possible solution, I don't need a parameter that won't fail 
    //the method but i still think there is a better way
    lazy val x = method(1)
    type ReturnType = x.type

    //I would then like to have a function which takes ReturnType as a parameter
    def doit(t:ReturnType) = Unit
