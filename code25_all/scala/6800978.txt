// Here is the important part of the answer
class Account(balance: Int) {
    def deposit(amount: Int): Account // the implementation was left out...
}

class Account {
  val balance = 0

  private def this(amount: Int) = {
    this()
    balance = amount // won't compile since balance is a val
  }

  def deposit(amount: Int): Account = new Account(balance + amount)
}
