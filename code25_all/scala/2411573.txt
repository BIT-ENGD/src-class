def someExtractorBuilder(arg:Boolean) = new {

//I would like to be able to use something like this 
val {someExtractorBuilder(true)}(result) = "test"
"test" match {case {someExtractorBuilder(true)}(result) => result }

//instead I would have to do this:
val customExtractor = someExtractorBuilder(true)
val customExtractor(result) = "test"
"test" match {case customExtractor(result) => result}
