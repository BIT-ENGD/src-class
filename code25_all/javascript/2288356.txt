/*code the process that calculates a new array containing the differences between all the pairs
of adjacent numbers, using the difference() function you have already written.
This function should be named calculateDifferences() and should accept an array numberArray. 
The function should first create a new empty array of the same size as numberArray
It should then calculate the differences between the pairs of adjacent numbers, 
using the difference() function, and store them in the new array. Finally, the function should return the new array.
The calculation of the differences should be done in a loop, at each step finding the difference between each 
array element and the next one along in the array, all except for the last difference,
which must be dealt with as a special case, because after the last element we have to wrap round to the start again. 
So the final difference is between the last and first elements in the array.*/
