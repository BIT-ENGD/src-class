attachFile: (Information collected from selenium API http://release.seleniumhq.org/selenium-remote-control/1.0-beta-2/doc/java/com/thoughtworks/selenium/Selenium.html#attachFile(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String))

void attachFile(java.lang.String fieldLocator,
            java.lang.String fileLocator)

Sets a file input (upload) field to the file listed in fileLocator

Parameters:
    fieldLocator - an element locator
    fileLocator - a URL pointing to the specified file. Before the file can be set
  in the input field (fieldLocator), Selenium RC may need to transfer the file to 
  the local machine before attaching the file in a web page form. This is common in 
  selenium grid configurations where the RC server driving the browser is not the 
  same machine that started the test. Supported Browsers: Firefox ("*chrome") only.
