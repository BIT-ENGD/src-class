tinyMCE.init() call to the  <script/> tag containing $(document).ready() call—before, after, and inside this call.  No result.  When tinyMCE.init() was called from within $(document).ready() handler, the browser did hang on request—looks like it was too late to call the init function.

Then, after googling a bit about using TinyMCE together with jQuery, I changed tinyMCE.init() call to:

tinyMCE.init({ mode:"none", theme:"simple", language:"pl" });


and added following jQuery call to the $(document).ready() handler:

$(".mce").each( function(i) { tinyMCE.execCommand("mceAddControl",true,this.id); });


Still the same error.  But, and here's where things start to look like real voodoo, when I added alert(i); before the tinyMCE.execCommand() call, alerts were given, and TinyMCE textareas were initialized correctly.  I figured this can be a matter of delay introduced by waiting for user dismissing the alert, so I introduced a second of delay by changing the call, still within the $(document).ready() handler, to following:
