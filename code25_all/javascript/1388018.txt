var a = $("#a");
var b = $("#b");

//I want to do something as such as the following : 

$(a,b).click(function () {/* */}); // <= does not work

//instead of attaching the handler to each one separately

$
context
&
$(a & b).click(function () { /* */ }); // <= works (event is attached to both)

$(a & b).attr("disabled", true); // <= doesn't work (nothing happens)
