$("input").val('@user').focus(); // this goes to start of the input box and foucs from start, but i want it to focus after the @user

$("input").val('@user today i did new things').focus(5); // i added 5 in focus method, obviously its not supported yet!, but the idea behind is, to focus it after @user from complete word.
