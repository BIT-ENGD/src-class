alert($(".bzsUserSelector-selected A"));
// this returns "[object]", which is expected

alert($(".bzsUserSelector-selected A").length);
// this returns "4", which is expected for my example

alert($(".bzsUserSelector-selected A").attr("myAttribute"))
// this returns "aaa", which is the value of the FIRST "myAttribute" only, I don't want that.
// I want something like this  "aaa, bbb, ccc, ddd"
