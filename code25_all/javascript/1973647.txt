        // load latest version of jQuery 
    }

    // load latest version of jQuery

// dance to avoid trampling any other libraries, etc. that the 
// user may be utilizing.

// The rest of my code lives here, happy in the knowledge that it's running in
// isolation from the rest of the JS that the page knows about.
