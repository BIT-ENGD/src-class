Pseudocode:
1. Say I wanted to get all input and textarea elements within a table myTbl
2. Declare resultingArray = null
3. For each tag (ex: input, textarea)
4.   tagArray = Get all elements based on tag
5.   Create another array by manually looping through tagArray and adding 
it to resultingArray (the return type is dynamic collection and not an array.
