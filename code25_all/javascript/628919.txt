If I use Visual Studio to debug JS, can I have it setup to automatically open the line that caused the error in VS when I am not in debug mode? (We have a large .NET solution and to get to the JS debugger, I have to start in debug mode (The script explorer does not show up if I simply attach the debugger later))
