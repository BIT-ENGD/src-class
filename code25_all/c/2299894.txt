1. LOCAL_EVENT occured
2. Broadcasted LOCAL_EVENT_INFO on network
3. All machines received EVENT_INFO, including the original broadcaster
4. All machines started executing the local action, including the original broadcaster
5. All machines' network listener(thread)s are sleeping
6. Another LOCAL_EVENT2 occured
7. Since all machines' listener are sleeping, LOCAL_EVENT2 is ignored
8. All machines' network listener(thread)s are now active again
9. GO BACK TO 1 / RESTART CYCLE
RESULT = TOTAL 2 EVENTS, 1 IGNORED

7. Eventhough all machines' listener are sleeping; LOCAL_EVENT2 is queued  SOMEHOW
8. All machines' network listener(thread)s are now active again
9. All machines received EVENT_INFO2 and executed local actions again, slept and reactivated
10. GO BACK TO 1 / RESTART CYCLE
RESULT = TOTAL 2 EVENTS, 0 IGNORED
