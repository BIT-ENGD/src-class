Hello World!---full of garbage until 100th byte---

char *var = malloc(100 + 1);

read(0, var, 100); // read from stdin. Unfortunately, I do not know how many bytes to read and stdin is not guaranteed to hold an EOF. (I chose 100 as an educated guess.)

var[100] = '\0'; // Is it possible to place a terminator at the end if most of the read bytes are garbage ?
