   The  function  sox_write  writes  len samples from buf using the format
   handler specified by ft. Data in buf must be 32-bit signed samples  and
   will  be converted during the write process. The value of len is speci-
   fied in total samples. If its value is not evenly divisable by the num-
   ber of channels, undefined behavior will occur.
