Thread 159 (process 1093):
#0  0x2aac15dc in _Unwind_GetCFA () from /lib/libpthread.so.0
#1  0x2afdfde8 in ?? ()
warning: GDB cant find the start of the function at 0x2afdfde8.

    GDB is unable to find the start of the function at 0x2afdfde8
and thus cant determine the size of that functions stack frame.
This means that GDB may be unable to access that stack frame, or
the frames below it.
    This problem is most likely caused by an invalid program counter or
stack pointer.
    However, if you think GDB should simply search farther back
from 0x2afdfde8 for code which looks like the beginning of a
function, you can increase the range of the search using the set
heuristic-fence-post command.
Backtrace stopped: previous frame inner to this frame (corrupt stack?)
