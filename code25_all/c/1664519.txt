So I can have 
N Buffers = 11. (must be prime)
N/2 children = 5.

So child 2 would:
write into buffer 2, sleep, read from buffer 2. (now move 2 positions)
write into buffer 4, sleep, read from buffer 4. (now move 2 positions)
**remmeber we only have five buffers so we go around again*****
write into buffer 1, sleep, read from buffer 1. (now move 2 positions)
write into buffer 3, sleep, read from buffer 3. (now move 2 positions)
write into buffer 5, sleep, read from buffer 5. ***we stop moving here. N/2 moves already performed.
