ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 15 from 10)

  The new thread terminates in one of the following ways:

   * It  calls  pthread_exit(3),  specifying  an exit status value that is
     available  to  another  thread  in  the  same  process   that   calls
     pthread_join(3).

   * It  returns  from  start_routine().   This  is  equivalent to calling
     pthread_exit(3) with the value supplied in the return statement.

   * It is canceled (see pthread_cancel(3)).

   * Any of the threads in the process calls exit(3), or the  main  thread
     performs  a  return  from main().  This causes the termination of all
     threads in the process.

return(NULL);
