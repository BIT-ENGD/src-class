To merge with the math library libm.a you would type

 cc -o program_name prog.c -lm

when you compile the program. The -lm means: add in libm. If we wanted to add in the socket library libsocket.a to do some network programming as well, we would type

 cc -o program_name prog.c -lm -lsocket

and so on.
