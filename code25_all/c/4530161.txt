Can anyone please tell me the data structures that are best suited for storing the information the program has to elaborate.
How could i load the the data structure into the memory?

A INPUT 0 1 net1 1
B INPUT 0 1 net2 1
C INPUT 0 1 net3 1
G1 NOT 1 1 net1 net4 1
G2 OR 2 1 met3 net4 net5 1
G3 AND 2 1 net4 net2 net6 2
G4 AND 2 1 net6 net5 net7 2
D OUTPUT 1 0 net6 1
E OUTPUT 1 0 E 1 



In this example the critical path is A/G1/G2/G4/E with a delay of 7.
