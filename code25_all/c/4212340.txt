typedef struct
{

    Int16 real;
    Int16 imag;

}sCplx16;

Int32 Data; //Data has real-imag packed into 32 bits. real-imag are 16 bits each.

Fun( (sCplx16)Data);


fun.c

Fun(sCplx16 DataPtr)

{  

   //

}


Inside the function, I find that value received are mapped correctly to
DataPtr.real and DataPtr.imag.

Is this typecasting correct? Someone told me that it will vary with compiler.
meaning imaginary will be first 16 bits and real will be next 16 bits.
