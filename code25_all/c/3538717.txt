"hello hello hello"
2
int blankcounter(char* pline)
{                              
  int i=0;                  
  int counter = 0;            
  while (pline[i] != '\0')       
  {                               
    if (pline[i++] ==' ')
      counter++;
  }
  return counter;
}

i want my function to be able to return 2 but it returns 3 because of the space that appears just after the word
